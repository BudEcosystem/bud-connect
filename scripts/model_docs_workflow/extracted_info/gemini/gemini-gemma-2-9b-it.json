    "description": "Gemma 2 9B-IT is a mid-size, instruction-tuned language model from Google's second-generation Gemma family. With 9 billion parameters and a 8,192 token context window, it balances performance and resource efficiency. The model features sliding window attention, knowledge distillation from larger models, and safety mitigations, making it suitable for deployment on modest hardware.",
