    "description": "Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite Preview 02-05 is Google's most cost-efficient multimodal model in the Gemini 2.0 family, designed for high-volume, low-latency tasks with a 1 million token context window. It supports text, code, images, audio, and video inputs but outputs only text. The model improves quality over Gemini 1.5 Flash while maintaining speed and cost efficiency, making it ideal for lightweight multimodal tasks like image captioning and document summarization.",
