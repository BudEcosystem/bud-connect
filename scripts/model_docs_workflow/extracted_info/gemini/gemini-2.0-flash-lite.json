    "description": "Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite is a cost-efficient large language model developed by Google, designed to deliver better quality than Gemini 1.5 Flash at the same speed and cost. It features a 1 million token context window, supports multimodal inputs (text, images, audio, video), and maintains low latency. The model prioritizes efficiency over advanced features, making it ideal for high-volume, cost-sensitive applications.",
