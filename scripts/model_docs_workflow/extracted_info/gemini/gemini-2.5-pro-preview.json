    "description": "Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview is a preview/development model developed by Google, featuring native thinking capabilities, an extended context window, and full multimodal support. It excels in advanced reasoning, multi-step planning, and tool integration, with leading benchmark results in reasoning, code generation, mathematics, and science. Available in multiple preview versions (e.g., gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25 and gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06), it is designed for experimentation and research rather than production use.",
