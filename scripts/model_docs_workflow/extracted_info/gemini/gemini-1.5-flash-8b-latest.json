    "description": "Gemini 1.5 Flash 8B is a lightweight, multimodal model developed by Google for lower intelligence tasks requiring high-volume processing and cost efficiency. With 8 billion parameters, it supports text, images, audio, video, and PDF inputs but is optimized for speed and affordability over advanced capabilities. Now considered a legacy model, Google recommends migrating to newer Gemini 2.0 or 2.5 Flash variants for improved performance.",
