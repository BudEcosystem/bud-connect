    "description": "Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B-Exp-0827 is an experimental 8-billion-parameter multimodal model developed by Google, released on August 27, 2024. It is a compact, faster variant of Gemini 1.5 Flash, optimized for speed and efficiency with a 1,000,000-token context window. The model supports text, images, audio, video, and document processing, and is designed for developer feedback before its general availability release.",
