    "description": "Gemini Flash Experimental is an experimental large language model developed by Google, designed to test new features while prioritizing speed and cost-efficiency. Based on the Gemini Flash architecture, it supports multimodal inputs (text, images, audio) with a context window up to 1M tokens. These models serve as a testing ground for innovations that later graduate to stable versions like Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 Flash.",
