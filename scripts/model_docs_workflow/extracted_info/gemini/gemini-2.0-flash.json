    "description": "Gemini 2.0 Flash is Google's first model in the Gemini 2.0 family, designed as a low-latency workhorse with enhanced performance for the agentic era. It supports a 1 million token context window and multimodal inputs (text, images, audio, video) with text and in-line image outputs. The model outperforms Gemini 1.5 Pro on most benchmarks at twice the speed, featuring native tool use, compositional function calling, and real-time streaming capabilities via the Live API.",
