    "description": "Gemini 1.5 Pro is a mid-size multimodal model developed by Google, optimized for reasoning tasks with an industry-leading 2 million token context window. It processes diverse data types (text, images, audio, video) and supports up to 2,000 pages of text, 2 hours of video, 19 hours of audio, or 60,000 lines of code. However, it is now classified as a legacy model, with Google recommending newer alternatives like Gemini 2.0 Flash.",
