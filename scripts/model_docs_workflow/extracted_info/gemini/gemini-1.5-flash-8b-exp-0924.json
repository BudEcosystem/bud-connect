    "description": "Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B-Exp-0924 is an experimental 8-billion-parameter model in the Flash family, released on September 24, 2024. It supports multimodal inputs (text, images, audio, video, documents) with a 1,000,000-token context window. The model is optimized for chat, transcription, translation, summarization, and multimodal processing, with iterative improvements over prior experimental versions.",
