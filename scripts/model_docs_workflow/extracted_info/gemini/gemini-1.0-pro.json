    "description": "Gemini 1.0 Pro is a mid-tier multimodal large language model developed by Google in December 2023 as part of the original Gemini family. It balances performance and efficiency for diverse tasks, featuring native support for text, images, audio, and video. Now considered a legacy model, it has been superseded by newer Gemini versions like 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5.",
