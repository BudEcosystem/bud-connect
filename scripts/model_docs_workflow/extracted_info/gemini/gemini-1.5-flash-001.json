    "description": "Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-001 is a fast, lightweight multimodal model designed for high-volume, low-latency tasks. It supports text, image, audio, video, and PDF inputs with a 1,048,576-token context window and 8,192-token output limit. Optimized for speed, it excels in summarization, categorization, and real-time applications but is lighter than the Gemini 1.5 Pro variant.",
