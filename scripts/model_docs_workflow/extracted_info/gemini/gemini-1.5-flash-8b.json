    "description": "Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B is the smallest production model in Google's Gemini 1.5 family, optimized for speed and efficiency while maintaining 97% of the original Flash model's accuracy. It features a 1 million token context window, multimodal capabilities (text, images, audio, video, documents), and is designed for high-volume, low-latency tasks. Trained via distillation from larger Gemini models, it supports real-time applications and cost-effective deployments.",
