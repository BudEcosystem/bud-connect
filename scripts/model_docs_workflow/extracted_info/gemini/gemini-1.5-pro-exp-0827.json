    "description": "Gemini 1.5 Pro Experimental 0827 (exp-0827) is an advanced experimental multimodal model developed by Google, released in late August 2024. It enhances the Gemini 1.5 Pro architecture with optimizations for coding, mathematical reasoning, and complex prompt handling. The model supports up to 1 million tokens in context (2 million in certain configurations) and maintains an 8,192 token output limit. It replaced the exp-0801 version on September 3, 2024, and is optimized for tasks involving codebases, long-form documentation, and multi-file projects.",
