    "description": "Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental is Google's next-generation multimodal AI model with a 1 million token context window, supporting text, audio, video, and image inputs/outputs across over 140 languages. It improves speed (TTFT) and benchmarks over Gemini 1.5 Pro while introducing features like multimodal live API, native image generation, and compositional function calling. Currently in experimental phase with some features requiring private access.",
