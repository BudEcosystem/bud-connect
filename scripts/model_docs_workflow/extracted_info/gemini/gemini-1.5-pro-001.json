    "description": "Gemini 1.5 Pro 001 is a mid-size multimodal model developed by Google, designed for lightweight tasks while maintaining high performance across domains. It supports text, image, video, and audio inputs, with a standard context window of 128,000 tokens and experimental support up to 2,097,152 tokens. The model balances efficiency and quality, using less compute than Gemini 1.0 Ultra while achieving comparable performance.",
