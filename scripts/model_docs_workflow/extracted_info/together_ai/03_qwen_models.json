    "description": "The Qwen model family, developed by Alibaba Cloud's Qwen team and hosted on Together AI, includes multiple variants with parameter sizes ranging from 7B to 235B (22B active in MoE architecture). These decoder-only models support text, code, and vision tasks, with context lengths up to 32,768 tokens. Specialized models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B focus on programming, while Qwen2.5-VL-72B handles multimodal inputs. The family offers competitive pricing and deployment flexibility.",
