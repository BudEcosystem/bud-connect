    "description": "Together AI offers a suite of high-quality embedding models for transforming text into numerical vectors, supporting applications like search systems, recommendation engines, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The BAAI BGE series includes English and multilingual models with varying sizes (small, base, large) and specialized models for tasks like semantic similarity and long document retrieval. Key features include multi-functionality (dense/sparse/multi-vector retrieval), multilingual support (100+ languages), and extended context lengths (up to 8192 tokens).",
