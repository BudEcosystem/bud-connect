    "description": "Together AI's 4.1B-8B parameter models are mid-range language models designed for cost-effective applications requiring more capability than tiny models (under 4B) but less than larger models. They offer parameter ranges of 4.1B to 8B, support chat, language, and code tasks, and feature context windows of 8K-32K tokens. Optimized for fast inference and compatible with standard transformer architectures, they run on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere GPUs with distributed inference capabilities.",
