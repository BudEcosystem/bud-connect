    "description": "Together AI's 21.1B-41B parameter models are mid-range language models designed to balance performance and cost-effectiveness for production workloads. They support chat, language, and code generation tasks with varying context windows and include multimodal capabilities in some variants. Optimized using the Together Inference Stack and deployed on NVIDIA Blackwell/Hopper GPUs, these models emphasize fast inference and scalable deployment.",
