    "description": "DeepSeek-V3 is an advanced Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model developed by DeepSeek AI, featuring 671B total parameters with 37B activated per token. It offers a 131K-token context window, FP8 quantization, and excels in math, code generation, and multilingual tasks. Trained on 14.8 trillion tokens, it outperforms top models like GPT-4o on benchmarks such as MMLU (88.5%) and MATH-500 (90.2%).",

      "Requires modern GPU infrastructure (NVIDIA H100/H800, AMD, or Huawei Ascend) for optimal performance",
      "High inference cost ($1.25 per 1M tokens) due to model size and computational demands",
      "No built-in content moderation requires external filtering implementation",
      "Theoretical maximum inference speed of ~67 tokens/second may lag behind smaller models",
      "131K context window may still be insufficient for extremely long documents"
