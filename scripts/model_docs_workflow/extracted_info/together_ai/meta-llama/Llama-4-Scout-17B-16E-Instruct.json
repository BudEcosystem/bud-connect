    "description": "Llama 4 Scout 17B 16E Instruct is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model developed by Meta and hosted on Together AI. It features 17 billion active parameters (109B total) with a 320K standard context length (up to 10 million tokens) and supports 12 languages. The model integrates text and vision via early fusion technology, enabling advanced multi-document analysis, codebase reasoning, and personalized tasks while fitting on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU using int4 quantization.",

    "strengths": [
      "Delivers best-in-class performance for 17B parameter multimodal models, outperforming competitors like Gemma 3, Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite, and Mistral 3.1",
      "Supports up to 10 million token context windows with efficient single-GPU deployment (NVIDIA H100) via int4 quantization",
      "Native multimodal architecture with early fusion technology for seamless text and vision integration",
      "Processes up to 5 images per request with advanced visual reasoning capabilities (object detection, multi-step image analysis)",
      "Optimized for multi-document analysis, codebase understanding, and personalized task adaptation"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Maximum context limit of 10 million tokens may constrain extremely large-scale applications",
      "Restricted to 5 image inputs per request for multimodal tasks",
      "Requires substantial GPU resources (NVIDIA H100) for deployment",
      "Higher cost compared to smaller models for basic applications",
      "May be overkill for simple tasks due to its advanced capabilities"
