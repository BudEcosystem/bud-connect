    "description": "Llama 3.3 70B Instruct Turbo is a 70-billion-parameter multilingual chat model developed by Meta and hosted on Together AI. It uses FP8 quantization for performance optimization, supports a 128K-token context window, and excels in multilingual dialogue, instruction following, and code generation. The model outperforms many open-source and closed chat models on industry benchmarks like MMLU (71.3%) and is optimized for high-quality conversational AI applications.",
