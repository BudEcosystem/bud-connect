    "description": "DeepSeek Coder is a specialized open-source code language model developed by DeepSeek AI, designed for programming tasks like code generation, completion, and understanding. It features a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with parameter sizes ranging from 1B to 236B, a 128K token context window, and supports 338 programming languages. Trained on 10.2 trillion tokens (60% code, 10% math, 30% natural language), it offers cost-effective API pricing and commercial-friendly licensing.",

    "strengths": [
      "Achieves performance comparable to GPT4-Turbo in code-specific tasks with open-source accessibility",
      "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture enables 16B/236B parameter models with only 2.4B/21B active parameters for efficiency",
      "Supports 338 programming languages, making it one of the most versatile code models available",
      "Cost-effective API pricing (27x cheaper than OpenAI o1) with off-peak discounts and context caching",
      "Outperforms open-source competitors like CodeLlama-34B by +7.9% on HumanEval Python and +10.8% on MBPP",
      "OpenAI-compatible API for seamless integration with existing tools and workflows"

    "limitations": [
      "Requires 80GB \u00d7 8 GPUs for full model inference in BF16 format",
      "API data sent to DeepSeek servers may be used for training (privacy consideration)",
      "Trade-off between cost and performance compared to proprietary models like GPT-4",
      "Limited to code-specific tasks rather than general-purpose language capabilities"
