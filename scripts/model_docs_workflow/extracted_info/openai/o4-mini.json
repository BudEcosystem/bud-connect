    "description": "OpenAI o4-mini is a cost-efficient, smaller model optimized for fast reasoning in math, coding, and visual tasks. It integrates text and images natively, offering a 200,000-token context window and 100,000-token output capacity. The model excels in mathematical reasoning (99.5% pass@1 on AIME 2025) and coding benchmarks (Codeforces, SWE-bench), with a 0.832 MMLU score for general knowledge.",

    "limitations": [
      "Higher latency (39.43 seconds TTFT) due to reasoning-intensive processes.",
      "More computationally intensive than non-reasoning models.",
      "Best suited for reasoning tasks rather than simple queries.",
      "Limited to specific image formats and quality requirements for visual tasks."
