    "description": "OpenAI o3-pro, released on June 10, 2025, is an enhanced version of the o3 model designed for complex problem-solving with improved reasoning capabilities and reduced costs. It replaces o1-pro for Pro and Team users, featuring the same architecture as o3 but optimized for reliability, reduced hallucinations, and access to tools like web search, code execution, and multi-tool orchestration. The model's knowledge cutoff is October 2023.",

    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Uses enhanced computing power for better responses to complex reasoning tasks with fewer hallucinations.",
      "87% cheaper than o1-pro, making advanced reasoning more accessible while maintaining high accuracy.",
      "Outperforms competitors like Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro in mathematics and Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus in science benchmarks.",
      "Supports multi-tool workflows, visual reasoning, and long-form analysis for comprehensive problem-solving.",
      "Improved reliability and consistency across domains like research, programming, and business analysis."
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Longer response times compared to o1-pro due to increased computational requirements.",
      "4x higher input and 10x higher output costs than base o3, making it less cost-effective for simpler tasks.",
      "Knowledge cutoff remains at October 2023, limiting access to post-2023 data.",
      "Initial launch limitations included disabled chats, no image generation, and missing Canvas features.",
      "May be overkill for standard reasoning tasks where base o3 suffices."
