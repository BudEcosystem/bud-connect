    "description": "GPT-4-0314 is a static snapshot version of GPT-4 developed by OpenAI, released on March 14, 2023. It features a standard context length of 8,192 tokens and an extended version of 32,768 tokens (gpt-4-32k-0314), with training data cutoff in September 2021. The model supports advanced NLP tasks like text generation, translation, and code understanding but lacks function calling and vision capabilities. It was deprecated on June 13, 2024, with migration recommended to newer GPT-4 variants.",

    "limitations": [
      "No function calling support (introduced in later models like gpt-4-0613)",
      "Limited to text-only inputs with no vision/image processing capabilities",
      "Static model with no post-release updates or improvements",
      "Training data cutoff in September 2021, limiting knowledge of newer developments",
      "Higher cost per token compared to newer, more efficient GPT-4 variants",
      "Fully deprecated and inaccessible as of June 13, 2024"
