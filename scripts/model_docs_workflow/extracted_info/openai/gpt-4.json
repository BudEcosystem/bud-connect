    "description": "GPT-4 is a large multimodal model developed by OpenAI that accepts text and image inputs to produce text outputs. It features a 8,192 token (8K) or 32,768 token (32K) context window, with training data cutoff in September 2021. The model demonstrates human-level performance on professional and academic benchmarks, with enhanced reasoning, creativity, and safety alignment compared to previous versions. It includes multimodal capabilities for image analysis, document understanding, and function calling in 0613+ versions.",
