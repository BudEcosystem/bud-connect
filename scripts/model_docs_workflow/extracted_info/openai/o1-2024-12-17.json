    "description": "OpenAI o1-2024-12-17 is an advanced reasoning model developed by OpenAI, released on December 17, 2024. It features a 200,000-token context window, 100,000-token max output, and a knowledge cutoff of September 30, 2023. The model emphasizes self-fact-checking, chain-of-thought reasoning, and a `reasoning_effort` parameter (low/medium/high) to control processing time. It supports vision capabilities, structured JSON outputs, and function calling for external API integration.",

    "strengths": [
      "Self-fact-checking mechanism reduces common errors and improves accuracy",
      "Chain-of-thought training enables refined problem-solving and mistake recognition",
      "Adjustable `reasoning_effort` parameter (low/medium/high) for task-specific performance tuning",
      "Outperforms GPT-4o in function calling and structured output generation",
      "Supports vision reasoning for applications in science, manufacturing, and coding",
      "Sets new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks for complex reasoning tasks"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Higher latency compared to GPT-4o due to extended reasoning processes",
      "Significantly more expensive ($15/million input tokens, $60/million output tokens)",
      "Limited initial access to 'tier 5' OpenAI users (minimum $1,000 spent, 30-day account age)",
      "Not optimized for low-latency tasks, multimodal input/output needs, or simple conversational use cases",
      "Reasoning tokens are billed as output tokens, increasing cost for complex tasks"
