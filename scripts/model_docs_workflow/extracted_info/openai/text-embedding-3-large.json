    "description": "Text-embedding-3-large is OpenAI's best-performing text embedding model, designed to convert text into high-dimensional vectors for semantic analysis. It offers 3,072 default dimensions with flexible size adjustment, supports up to 8,191 tokens via the cl100k_base tokenizer, and features improved multilingual capabilities. The model excels in semantic search, clustering, classification, and cross-lingual retrieval tasks.",
