    "description": "Text-embedding-ada-002 is a transformer-based embedding model developed by OpenAI, released in December 2022. It generates 1,536-dimensional unit-length vectors using the cl100k_base tokenizer, with a maximum input of 8,191 tokens. While superseded by the text-embedding-3 series, it remains supported for legacy systems and applications requiring fixed-dimension embeddings.",

      "Legacy systems requiring stable, fixed-dimension embeddings",
      "Document clustering and semantic search in production environments",

      "Recommendation engines with pre-existing vector database integrations"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Reliable performance with extensive production usage and maturity",
      "Broad compatibility with existing systems and vector databases",
      "Predictable behavior and well-documented implementation",
      "Stable pricing ($0.0001 per 1K tokens) with no planned deprecation",
      "Proven effectiveness for semantic search, clustering, and similarity tasks",
      "MTEB score of 61.0% for general-purpose embedding quality"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Fixed 1,536-dimensional output with no flexibility for reduction",
      "Higher cost compared to newer models (5x more expensive than text-embedding-3-small)",
      "Lower multilingual performance relative to updated models",
      "No recent training data updates since December 2022",
      "MIRACL score of 31.4% indicates weaker cross-lingual retrieval capabilities"
