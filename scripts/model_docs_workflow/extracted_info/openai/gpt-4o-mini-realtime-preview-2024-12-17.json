    "limitations": [
      "Preview status - not optimized for production traffic or high-volume deployments",
      "Limited to text and audio modalities (no image support)",
      "Does not support existing GPT-4o structured output features",
      "Rate limits (100,000 TPM, 1,000 RPM) suitable only for testing/development",
      "Requires stable internet connection for optimal performance",
      "May exhibit stability issues typical of preview releases",
      "Latency sensitivity to network conditions"
