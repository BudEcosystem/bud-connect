    "description": "GPT-4-Vision-Preview is a deprecated multimodal model developed by OpenAI, combining GPT-4's language capabilities with vision understanding. It supports image analysis (PNG, JPEG, WEBP, non-animated GIFs up to 20MB), document reading, and real-world scene interpretation. The model uses a token-based pricing structure with costs varying by image resolution and size. Note: It was replaced by newer models like GPT-4o as of March 2025.",
