  "model_info": {
    "description": "GPT-4-0613 is a static snapshot version of OpenAI's GPT-4 model released on June 13, 2023. It features an 8,192-token context window, transformer-based architecture, and supports function calling but lacks vision capabilities. The model is trained on diverse internet data up to its knowledge cutoff and remains available in maintenance mode with no planned updates.",
