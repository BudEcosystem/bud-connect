    "description": "DALL-E 3 is OpenAI's advanced image generation model with improved understanding of nuance and detail. It supports multiple aspect ratios, adjustable quality settings, and enhanced text rendering within images. The model generates images via text prompts and offers 'vivid' or 'natural' style options, with higher resolution outputs available in HD quality.",

      "Generated image URLs expire after one hour",
      "Higher latency for HD quality generation",
      "More expensive than DALL-E 2 (HD is 2x standard cost)",
      "No backward compatibility for edit features from DALL-E 2"
