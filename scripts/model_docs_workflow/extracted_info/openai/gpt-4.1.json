    "description": "GPT-4.1 is a flagship model developed by OpenAI, released in April 2025 as a major upgrade to the GPT-4o series. It features a 1 million token context window (up from 128,000), enhanced coding capabilities, and improved long-context understanding. Trained on data up to June 2024, it offers 26% lower cost than GPT-4o and 83% reduced latency, with specialized optimizations for web development and instruction-following tasks.",

    "strengths": [
      "1 million token context window for processing extensive documents and complex tasks",
      "21.4% improvement over GPT-4o on SWE-bench Verified and 10.5% on MultiChallenge benchmark",
      "72.0% score on Video-MME long, no subtitles category (6.7% improvement over GPT-4o)",
      "26% lower cost and nearly half the latency of GPT-4o with 75% prompt caching discount",

    "limitations": [
      "API-only access with no direct fine-tuning available",
      "Image processing converts images to tokens, consuming context window capacity",
      "Not recommended for simple classification tasks (GPT-4.1-nano is more cost-effective)",
      "For complex reasoning tasks, o3 models may still be more suitable"
