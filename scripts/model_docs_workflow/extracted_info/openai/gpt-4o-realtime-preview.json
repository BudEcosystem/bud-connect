    "description": "GPT-4o-realtime-preview is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI for real-time voice interactions. It enables low-latency speech-to-speech conversations via WebSocket/WebRTC connections, eliminating the need for intermediate transcription steps. The December 2024 version offers improved voice quality, reliable input handling, and 60%+ cheaper audio pricing. It supports emotion preservation, function calling, and multimodal text/audio inputs/outputs.",
