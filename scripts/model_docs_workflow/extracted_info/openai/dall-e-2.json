    "description": "DALL-E 2 is an image generation model developed by OpenAI that creates realistic images and art from text descriptions. It supports text-to-image generation, image editing, and concept combination across multiple sizes (1024\u00d71024, 512\u00d7512, 256\u00d7256). The model outputs image URLs valid for one hour and includes features like variations and edits through its API.",
