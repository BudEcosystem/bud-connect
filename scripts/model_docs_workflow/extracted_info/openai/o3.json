    "description": "The OpenAI o3 model is a cutting-edge language model designed for advanced reasoning and complex problem-solving, particularly excelling in STEM fields. It features a 200,000-token context window and 100,000-token maximum output, with a knowledge cutoff in June 2024. The model outperforms competitors on benchmarks like AIME 2024 (mathematical reasoning) and GPQA Diamond (scientific understanding), and is optimized for technical and academic applications.",
