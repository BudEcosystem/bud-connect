  "model_info": {
    "description": "GPT-4o is OpenAI's flagship multimodal model capable of real-time reasoning across audio, vision, and text. It features a 128,000-token context window, GPT-4-level intelligence, and native multimodal processing with a knowledge cutoff of October 2023. The model supports advanced API integrations and offers improved efficiency and cost-effectiveness compared to GPT-4 Turbo.",

    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Multimodal analysis combining text, images, and audio inputs",
      "Complex reasoning tasks requiring extended context (128K tokens)",
      "Code generation and debugging across multiple programming languages",
      "Enterprise applications like business analysis, report generation, and customer service",
      "Real-time applications with streaming responses (e.g., chatbots)",
      "Visual question answering, document processing, and diagram interpretation"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "128,000-token context window with 16,384 output tokens per request for extended processing",
      "Native multimodal capabilities (text, vision, audio) with real-time processing and reduced latency",
      "High language understanding benchmarks: MMLU 87.2%, HellaSwag 95.3%, HumanEval 90.2%",
      "Strong vision performance: MMMU 69.1%, MathVista 63.8%, AI2D 94.2%",
      "Cost-efficient pricing (50% discount on batch API) and API compatibility with GPT-4",
      "Advanced features including structured outputs, function calling, and streaming responses"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Knowledge cutoff at October 2023 limits access to newer information",
      "Audio processing capabilities remain in preview/development phase",
      "Image inputs require URL/base64 encoding (no direct file upload)",
      "Complex vision tasks may consume more tokens, increasing costs",
      "Context limit of 128K tokens (input + output) may restrict very long interactions"
