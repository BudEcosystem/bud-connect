    "description": "OpenAI o3-mini is a small reasoning model developed by OpenAI, optimized for STEM tasks like mathematics, coding, and science. It supports function calling, structured outputs, and developer messages, with a 200,000-token context window and 100,000-token output limit. The model offers three reasoning effort levels (low, medium, high) and is 24% faster and 93% cheaper than the o1 model while maintaining comparable performance.",
