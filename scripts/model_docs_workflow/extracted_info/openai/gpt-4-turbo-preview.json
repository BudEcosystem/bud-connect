    "description": "GPT-4 Turbo Preview is a next-generation language model developed by OpenAI, offering a 128,000-token context window (equivalent to 300+ pages of text) and knowledge updated through April 2023. It provides cost reductions of 3x for input tokens and 2x for output tokens compared to GPT-4, with vision capabilities available via a separate model variant (`gpt-4-vision-preview`).",
