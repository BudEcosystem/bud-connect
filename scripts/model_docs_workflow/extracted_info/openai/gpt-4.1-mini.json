    "description": "GPT-4.1-mini is a fast, efficient small model in the GPT-4.1 family developed by OpenAI, offering significant improvements in instruction-following, coding, and overall intelligence compared to GPT-4o mini. It features a 1 million token context window (matching GPT-4.1), a training data cutoff of June 2024, and 83% lower cost than GPT-4o. The model supports image inputs and is optimized for high-volume, low-latency applications.",
