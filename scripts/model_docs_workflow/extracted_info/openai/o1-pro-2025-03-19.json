    "description": "OpenAI o1-pro is the company's most advanced reasoning model, released on March 19, 2025. It uses significantly more computing power than standard o1 to deliver superior reliability and consistency for complex problem-solving. The model features a 200,000-token context window, 100,000-token output limit, and supports image inputs, function calling, and structured outputs. It is exclusively available via OpenAI's Responses API for multi-turn interactions.",
