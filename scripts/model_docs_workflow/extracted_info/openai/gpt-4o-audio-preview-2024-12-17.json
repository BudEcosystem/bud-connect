    "description": "GPT-4o Audio Preview (2024-12-17) is a multimodal AI model developed by OpenAI that supports text and audio processing. It enables asynchronous audio interactions with speech-in/speech-out capabilities, 20 MB audio file size limit, and WAV output format. Built on the GPT-4o architecture, it offers enhanced audio understanding, sentiment analysis, and voice synthesis with three distinct voice options.",
