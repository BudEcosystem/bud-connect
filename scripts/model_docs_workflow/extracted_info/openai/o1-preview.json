    "description": "OpenAI o1-preview is an advanced AI model designed for complex reasoning in science, coding, and mathematics. It uses reinforcement learning-enhanced chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with a 128,000-token context window and 32,768-token output limit. The model's knowledge is current through October 1, 2023, and it features a transformer architecture optimized for deep problem-solving.",

    "use_cases": [
      "Solving complex mathematical problems (e.g., IMO/AIME benchmarks).",
      "Advanced coding tasks, including code generation and debugging.",
      "Scientific research applications (e.g., physics formula generation, cell sequencing data annotation).",
      "Educational tools requiring step-by-step reasoning explanations.",
      "High-accuracy workflows where reasoning depth outweighs latency concerns."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Excels in mathematics with an 83% score on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam, surpassing GPT-4o's 13%.",
      "Achieves 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions and strong performance on HumanEval coding benchmarks.",
      "Matches PhD-level performance in physics, chemistry, and biology research tasks.",
      "Demonstrates advanced jailbreak resistance with an 84 score on the hardest jailbreaking tests (vs. GPT-4o's 22).",
      "Utilizes internal 'reasoning tokens' for deeper, more complex problem-solving without fixating on failed reasoning paths."
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Significantly more expensive than standard models, with input/output token costs of $15.00 and $60.00 per 1M tokens.",
      "Slower response times (17.03 seconds TTFT and 171.5 tokens/second) compared to GPT-4o due to internal reasoning processes.",
      "Beta phase limitations: no image/web support, file uploads, code interpreter, or streaming capabilities.",
      "Strict API rate limits (20 RPM for qualified developers) and weekly message caps (50 queries/week).",
      "Not ideal for tasks prioritizing speed or requiring multimodal input/output."
