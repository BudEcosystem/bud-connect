    "description": "The `omni-moderation-latest-intents` is a speculative OpenAI model focused on intent detection and behavioral analysis. Based on the GPT-4o architecture, it is hypothesized to specialize in identifying harmful intentions (e.g., grooming, radicalization, fraud) through multi-turn conversation analysis. However, it is not officially documented by OpenAI and remains unverified.",

    "use_cases": [
      "Social platform safety monitoring for manipulation or grooming attempts",
      "Child safety protection on online platforms",

    "strengths": [
      "Hypothetical enhanced capability to detect harmful intentions beyond basic content moderation",
      "Potential for multi-turn conversation analysis to understand evolving intent patterns",
      "Specialized intent categories (e.g., grooming, radicalization) for targeted safety applications",

    "limitations": [
      "Not officially documented or verified by OpenAI",
      "Lacks confirmed technical specifications or performance metrics",
      "Higher computational cost and processing time for deep intent analysis",
      "Potential for increased false positives due to the complexity of intent detection",
