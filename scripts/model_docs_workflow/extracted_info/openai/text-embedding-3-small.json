    "description": "Text-embedding-3-small is OpenAI's cost-effective text embedding model that outperforms text-embedding-ada-002 on most benchmarks while being 5x cheaper. It provides 1,536-dimensional normalized vector embeddings (with flexible dimensionality reduction) and supports up to 8,191 tokens using the cl100k_base tokenizer. The model excels in semantic search, document clustering, classification, and content deduplication tasks.",
