  "model_info": {
    "description": "GPT-4o mini is a cost-efficient small model developed by OpenAI, designed for high-volume, cost-sensitive applications. It features a 128,000-token context window, 16,384-token output limit, and improved non-English text handling. The model supports text and vision inputs with upcoming audio/video capabilities, and includes safety features like instruction hierarchy and resistance to jailbreaks.",

    "limitations": [
      "Knowledge cutoff in October 2023 limits access to post-2023 information.",
      "16,384-token output limit per request may restrict complex response generation.",
      "Audio/video support remains in development and not yet available.",
      "Reduced performance on highly complex reasoning tasks compared to larger models like GPT-4o.",
      "MMMU benchmark score of 59.4% indicates moderate multimodal performance relative to competitors."
