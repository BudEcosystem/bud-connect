    "description": "GPT-4.5-preview is a research preview model developed by OpenAI as their largest and best chat model at release. It was designed for experimentation with large-scale architectures but was deprecated in favor of the more efficient GPT-4.1 family. The model had a smaller context window than GPT-4.1's 1 million tokens and was compute-intensive, with an unspecified training data cutoff.",
