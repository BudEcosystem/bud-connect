    "description": "GPT-4o-mini-realtime-preview is a real-time, low-latency variant of OpenAI's GPT-4o mini model designed for speech-to-speech and text-based conversational interactions. It supports a 128K token context window, 16K output tokens, and multimodal inputs (text and audio). The model features enhanced tokenization for non-English text, strong function calling capabilities, and robust safety mechanisms like instruction hierarchy and jailbreak resistance. It has a knowledge cutoff of October 2023 and is optimized for applications requiring real-time audio processing and multilingual support.",

    "limitations": [
      "Preview model not optimized for production traffic with limited rate limits for testing",
      "Currently restricted to text and audio modalities (image support pending)",
      "Knowledge cutoff at October 2023, limiting access to newer information",
      "High pricing for audio input/output tokens ($100/M for audio input, $200/M for audio output)",
      "Audio quality dependent on input source and network conditions",
      "Real-time requirements may introduce latency in certain scenarios"
