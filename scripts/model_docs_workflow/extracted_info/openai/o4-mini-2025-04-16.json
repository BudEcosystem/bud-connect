    "description": "OpenAI o4-mini, released on April 16, 2025, is a compact model optimized for fast, cost-efficient reasoning with strong performance in math, coding, and visual tasks. It replaces o3-mini, offering native multimodal input (text and images), tool compatibility (web browsing, Python execution, image analysis), and a 200,000-token context window. Available to all ChatGPT users, including free tier, it provides a 2.3x cost reduction over GPT-4o and outperforms o3-mini across benchmarks.",
    "tags": [],
    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Math tutoring with visual problem-solving and diagram analysis",
      "Software development tasks including code generation, review, and debugging",
      "Scientific research assistance with data analysis and technical documentation",
      "Business applications like financial modeling with chart interpretation",
      "Educational test preparation with multi-subject support and visual reasoning"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Achieves 92.7% on AIME 2025 (math) without tools and 99.5% with Python interpreter, outperforming o3 and o3-mini",
      "Supports native multimodal input (text + images) for visual reasoning and diagram analysis",
      "Costs 2.3x less than GPT-4o and an order of magnitude cheaper than o3, with API caching and batching for efficiency",
      "Available to all ChatGPT users (free tier) with paid variant (o4-mini-high) for enhanced complex task performance",
      "Excels in coding (Codeforces ELO 2719) and scientific reasoning (81.4% on GPQA Diamond PhD-level questions)"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Less capable than o3 on complex reasoning tasks and may struggle with extremely difficult problems",
      "Knowledge cutoff in October 2023 limits real-time data access",
      "Token limits (200k input, 100k output) may constrain very long tasks",
      "Rate limits apply based on user tier, with paid tiers required for o4-mini-high variant",
      "Less general-purpose than GPT-4o and less versatile for non-structured problems"
