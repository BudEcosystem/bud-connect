    "description": "GPT-4-32k-0613 is a variant of OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model with a 32,768-token context window, released on June 13, 2023. It maintains the core capabilities of the GPT-4-0613 series while extending context handling for lengthy documents. Key features include function calling support, improved coherence in long-form text, and multilingual capabilities.",
