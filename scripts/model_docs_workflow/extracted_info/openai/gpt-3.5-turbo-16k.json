  "model_info": {
    "description": "GPT-3.5 Turbo 16k is an extended context version of the GPT-3.5 Turbo model family developed by OpenAI. It supports a maximum context length of 16,384 tokens, enabling processing of longer documents and conversations while maintaining the efficiency of the base GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The model is optimized for chat-based interactions via the Chat Completions API and is available under the `gpt-3.5-turbo-16k` identifier with versioned variants.",
