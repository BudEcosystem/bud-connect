    "description": "Anthropic Claude models are available on Google Cloud Vertex AI as managed APIs, providing enterprise-grade access to Claude's capabilities without infrastructure management. The models include Claude 4 Series (e.g., Claude Opus 4 and Sonnet 4), Claude 3.7 Series, and Claude 3.5 Series (e.g., Haiku and Sonnet), each optimized for specific tasks like complex reasoning, coding, high-volume processing, and speed. Key features include hybrid reasoning modes, multimodal support (text/images), and enterprise security controls.",

      "Enterprise features like VPC Service Controls, CMEK, and audit logging for compliance and security.",
      "Model versioning with guaranteed consistent behavior using versioned identifiers (e.g., `claude-3-7-sonnet@20250219`).",
      "Streaming support for real-time responses and reduced latency in interactive applications.",
      "Cost-effective options like Claude 3.5 Haiku for high-volume, speed-critical tasks."
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Higher pricing for Claude Opus 4 ($15/$75 per million tokens) compared to other models.",
      "Vertex AI Agent Engine lacks support for data residency, CMEK, and Access Transparency (AXT) controls.",
      "Regional endpoint availability depends on specific Google Cloud regions supporting Anthropic models.",
      "Claude 3.7 Series is in preview, indicating potential instability or limited deployment readiness.",
      "Token-based billing may incur costs for long-context queries (over 200K tokens)."
