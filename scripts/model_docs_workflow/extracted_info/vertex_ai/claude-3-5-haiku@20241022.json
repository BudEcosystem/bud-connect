    "description": "Claude 3.5 Haiku@20241022 is a versioned large language model developed by Anthropic, optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness. Released on October 22, 2024, it supports a 200,000-token context window and 8,000-token output limit, with knowledge cutoff in July 2024. Available on Google Cloud Vertex AI since November 4, 2024, it emphasizes deterministic responses through versioned model IDs and supports features like batch predictions, prompt caching, and function calling.",
