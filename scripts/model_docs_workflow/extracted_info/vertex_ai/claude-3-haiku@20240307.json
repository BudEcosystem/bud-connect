    "description": "Claude 3 Haiku@20240307 is a versioned vision and text model developed by Anthropic for Vertex AI, optimized for speed and cost-effectiveness. It supports 200,000 input tokens, 8,000 output tokens, and multimodal inputs (text/images) with 5 MB per image limits. The model integrates with Google Cloud IAM, offers prompt caching, and is designed for high-volume, low-complexity tasks.",

    "limitations": [
      "8,000 token output limit restricts long-form responses",
      "5 MB maximum image file size and 20-image-per-request constraints",
      "Not optimized for complex reasoning or extended analytical tasks",
      "No batch processing capabilities",
      "Requires versioned model usage for production consistency",
      "Regional availability may vary (check Vertex AI documentation)"
