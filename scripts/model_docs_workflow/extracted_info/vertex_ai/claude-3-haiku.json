    "description": "Claude 3 Haiku is Anthropic's fastest vision and text model, optimized for speed and affordability. It supports up to 200,000 input tokens and 8,000 output tokens with a 21K+ tokens/second processing speed. Key features include vision processing, multi-language support, prompt caching, and streaming responses, but lacks batch predictions and extended thinking capabilities.",
