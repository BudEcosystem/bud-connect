    "description": "Grok-3 Fast Beta is a speed-optimized variant of xAI's Grok-3 model, offering identical quality with significantly reduced latency. It features a 131k token context window, 0.71-second time to first token, and 67ms average response latency. The model supports code interpretation, internet access, tool calling, and multi-language capabilities but lacks vision features and fine-tuning support. Knowledge is current through November 2024.",
