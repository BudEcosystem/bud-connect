    "description": "Grok-beta is xAI's experimental multimodal language model designed for testing new features and capabilities before stable releases. It maintains a 131,072-token context window and supports text and image inputs, with potential experimental modalities. As a beta release, it offers early access to advanced reasoning, extended tool use, and performance optimizations while retaining core Grok family capabilities.",
