    "description": "Grok-3 Mini Fast Beta is a speed-optimized variant of Grok-3 Mini developed by XAI, designed for real-time STEM applications requiring quick logical reasoning. It features a 131,072-token context window, sub-second response times, and a knowledge cutoff of November 2024. The model excels in mathematical solutions, code generation, and low-latency tool calling but lacks vision capabilities and fine-tuning options.",
