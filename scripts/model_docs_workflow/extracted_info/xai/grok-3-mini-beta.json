    "description": "Grok-3 Mini Beta is a cost-efficient reasoning model developed by xAI, optimized for logic-based tasks requiring minimal world knowledge. It features a 131,072-token context window, reinforcement learning training, and chain-of-thought reasoning. The model is 10x cheaper than Grok-3 Beta, supports multi-language inputs, and excels in STEM tasks, code generation, and mathematical problem-solving.",
