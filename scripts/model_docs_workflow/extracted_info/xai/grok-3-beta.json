    "description": "Grok-3 Beta is xAI's flagship enterprise-grade large language model designed for complex reasoning tasks. Trained on xAI's Colossus supercluster with 10x more compute than Grok-2, it features a 131,072-token context window and knowledge cutoff in November 2024. Key capabilities include code execution, internet access, tool calling, and multi-language support, with reasoning modes like 'Big Brain' for extended problem-solving.",
