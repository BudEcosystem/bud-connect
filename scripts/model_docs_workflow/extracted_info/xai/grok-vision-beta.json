    "description": "Grok Vision Beta is xAI's early-stage multimodal model introduced on November 19, 2024, offering basic vision capabilities for prototyping and experimentation. It supports image and text processing with an 8,192-token context window, handles JPG/PNG formats up to 10MB, and provides OCR and general visual analysis. Designed as a beta testing tier, it prioritizes accessibility for developers and researchers.",

    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Prototyping multimodal applications and proof-of-concept development",
      "Basic image description, captioning, and object identification",
      "Simple text extraction from images (OCR) for non-critical workflows",
      "Educational and research projects requiring accessible vision AI testing"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Cost-effective entry point for multimodal AI development and testing",
      "Basic image processing capabilities including OCR and simple document analysis",
      "Supports multiple languages and function calling for flexible integration",
      "Optimized for prototyping with a streamlined context window for focused tasks"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Limited to 8,192-token context window (1/4 of Grok-2 Vision's capacity)",
      "Higher per-token costs compared to production models (2.5x input, 1.5x output)",
      "Beta-level accuracy and reliability unsuitable for production workloads",
      "Restricted to basic vision tasks with limited performance on complex documents or high-resolution analysis",
      "Rate-limited to 1 request/second and 60 requests/hour for beta tier"
