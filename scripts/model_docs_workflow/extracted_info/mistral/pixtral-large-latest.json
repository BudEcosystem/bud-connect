    "description": "Pixtral Large is a 124B open-weights multimodal model built on Mistral Large 2. It combines a 123B parameter language model with a 1B parameter vision encoder, enabling sophisticated understanding of documents, charts, and natural images. The model has a 128,000 token context window and can process up to 30 high-resolution images per input while maintaining the text capabilities of Mistral Large 2.",
