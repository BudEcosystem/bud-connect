    "description": "Open Mistral 7B is a 7-billion-parameter transformer-based language model developed by Mistral AI, released under the Apache 2.0 license. It features a Sliding Window Attention (SWA) mechanism with a 4,096-token attention window and an 8K-token context window. The model is optimized for efficiency, outperforming larger models like Llama 2 13B and matching Llama 34B in performance despite being 5x smaller.",
