    "description": "Ministral 3B 2410 is a 3-billion parameter edge-optimized model developed by Mistral AI in October 2024. It features a 128,000 token context window and is part of the 'Les Ministraux' family, designed for resource-constrained environments. The model includes a 0.43x internal temperature scaling multiplier and supports function calling, fine-tuning, and real-time edge deployment.",
