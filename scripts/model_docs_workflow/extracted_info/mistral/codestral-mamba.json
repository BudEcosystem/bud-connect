    "description": "Codestral Mamba is a Mamba2-based language model specialized in code generation, developed by Mistral AI. It features 7.3B parameters, a non-transformer architecture with linear scaling for long contexts (up to 256K tokens), and is optimized for code understanding and reasoning tasks. Released under Apache 2.0 license, it offers competitive performance comparable to state-of-the-art transformer models.",
