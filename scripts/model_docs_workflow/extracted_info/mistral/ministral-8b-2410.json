    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Outperforms larger models like Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B in evaluation metrics",
      "128k token context window enables extensive document processing and long-form reasoning",
      "Internal temperature scaling (0.43x multiplier) provides precise output control",
      "Industry-leading performance/price ratio for edge computing applications",
      "Supports agentic workflows and function calling for complex task orchestration"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "8B parameter count may limit performance on very complex reasoning tasks",
      "Temperature scaling requires users to adjust settings with 0.43x multiplier in mind",
      "Requires minimum 16GB RAM and 8-core CPU for deployment",
      "Edge deployment still demands decent hardware (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin)",
      "Commercial use requires licensing agreement"
