    "description": "Amazon Titan Text Embeddings G1 (amazon.titan-embed-text-v1) is a first-generation text embeddings model developed by Amazon for converting text into 1,536-dimensional vector representations. It captures semantic relationships to enable tasks like similarity search, document retrieval, and text classification, with a maximum input of 8,192 tokens and English language optimization.",

    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) document retrieval",
      "Semantic search engines for content discovery",
      "Enterprise knowledge base organization and search",
      "E-commerce product recommendation systems",
      "Text classification feature extraction for ML models",
      "Duplicate content detection and clustering"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Captures deep semantic relationships in text for accurate similarity comparisons",
      "Supports batch processing for efficient enterprise-scale applications",
      "Provides high throughput and consistent performance across diverse inputs",
      "Seamlessly integrates with AWS services like OpenSearch, RDS, and SageMaker",
      "Delivers dense 1,536-dimensional vectors for detailed text representations"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Fixed 1,536-dimensional output cannot be adjusted for different use cases",
      "Primarily optimized for English text with suboptimal cross-language performance",
      "Higher memory and computational requirements compared to smaller dimension models",
      "No configurable inference parameters (e.g., maxTokenCount, topP)",
      "8,192 token input limit may require text segmentation for long documents"
