    "description": "Meta Llama 3.2 11B Instruct is a multimodal large language model developed by Meta, available on AWS Bedrock. It supports both text and image inputs with 11 billion parameters and a 128,000-token context window. The model integrates advanced vision capabilities for tasks like image captioning, visual question answering, and document analysis, while maintaining strong text generation and instruction-following skills. It supports eight languages: English, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai.",
