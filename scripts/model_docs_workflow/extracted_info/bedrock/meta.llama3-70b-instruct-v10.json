    "description": "Meta Llama 3 70B Instruct is a 70-billion-parameter large language model developed by Meta, offering enhanced reasoning, content creation, and enterprise capabilities. It features an 8K token context window (double Llama 2), 15 trillion training tokens (7x larger than Llama 2), and 4x more code training data. Optimized for AWS Bedrock, it supports advanced fine-tuning with SFT and RLHF, and is ideal for complex reasoning, conversational AI, and code generation.",

    "limitations": [
      "8K token context window may be insufficient for extremely long documents",
      "Higher computational and cost requirements compared to smaller models",
      "May not match capabilities of larger models (e.g., Llama 3.1 70B with 128K context)",
      "Performance may vary in highly specialized domain knowledge scenarios",
      "Requires AWS Bedrock integration for deployment"
