    "description": "Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 is a second-generation text embeddings model developed by AWS, optimized for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It supports up to 8,192 tokens (50,000 characters) with flexible output dimensions (256, 384, or 1,024) and improved multilingual capabilities for 100+ languages. The model offers enhanced cost efficiency, binary embeddings, and integration with AWS services like Bedrock Knowledge Bases.",

    "strengths": [
      "Enhanced RAG optimization for improved retrieval-augmented generation workflows",
      "33% cost reduction compared to V1 due to smaller default dimensions (1,024 vs. 1,536)",
      "Flexible output dimensions (256, 384, or 1,024) with 4x cost savings at 256 dimensions (3.24% accuracy loss)",
      "Multilingual preview support for 100+ languages beyond English",
      "Binary embeddings support via the embeddingTypes parameter",
      "Native integration with AWS Bedrock Knowledge Bases and vector databases like OpenSearch",
      "MTEB benchmark score of 60.37, demonstrating strong semantic similarity and reranking performance"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Maximum input token limit of 8,192 tokens may restrict processing of very long texts",
      "Multilingual support is in preview with varying performance levels across 100+ languages",
      "Suboptimal cross-language similarity performance for non-English text",
      "Binary embeddings are a newer feature with potential limitations",
      "Accuracy trade-offs with smaller dimensions (e.g., 3.24% loss at 256 dimensions)",
      "Language optimization prioritizes English, with reduced effectiveness for other languages"
