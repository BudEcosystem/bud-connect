    "description": "Cohere models on AWS Bedrock provide enterprise-grade access to advanced language models, embeddings, and reranking capabilities. These models excel in search, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and multilingual applications, supporting 10 key business languages. Text generation models like Command R+ and Command R offer large context windows (128,000 tokens), while embedding models (e.g., Cohere Embed 3) support multimodal inputs (text and images). The reranking model (Cohere Rerank 3.5) enhances search relevance for RAG systems.",

    "limitations": [
      "Regional availability varies for models like Rerank 3.5 (limited to specific AWS regions)",
      "Feature parity with direct Cohere APIs may lag due to AWS integration timelines",
      "Limited customization to AWS-supported configurations compared to direct provider access",
      "Command Light's smaller context window (4,096 tokens) restricts handling of complex tasks",
      "Rerank 3.5 pricing scales per query, which may increase costs for high-volume applications"
