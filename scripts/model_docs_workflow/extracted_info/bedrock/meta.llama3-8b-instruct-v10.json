    "description": "Meta Llama 3 8B Instruct is a 8-billion-parameter language model developed by Meta, optimized for efficiency and performance. It features an 8K context window (double Llama 2's capacity), training on 15 trillion tokens (7x larger than Llama 2), and 4x more code data for enhanced programming capabilities. Designed for edge devices and resource-constrained environments, it excels in text processing, classification, and basic reasoning tasks.",
