    "strengths": [
      "Ultra-lightweight with 1 billion parameters for maximum efficiency and low computational requirements.",
      "128K token context window enables processing of long documents and extended conversation history.",
      "Edge-optimized for deployment on IoT devices, mobile apps, and offline environments with minimal latency.",
      "Cost-effective for high-volume, budget-sensitive applications with ultra-low per-token pricing.",
      "Strong performance in retrieval, classification, and summarization tasks for well-defined use cases."
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Limited complexity handling compared to larger models; struggles with sophisticated reasoning or creative writing.",
      "Regional availability restrictions due to geofencing (e.g., US West, Europe) may limit deployment flexibility.",
      "Not ideal for advanced analysis, complex problem-solving, or tasks requiring extensive contextual understanding.",
      "Performance may degrade with highly complex or ambiguous inputs beyond basic task automation."
