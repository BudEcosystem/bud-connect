    "description": "Claude 3 Opus is the most intelligent model in the Claude 3 family, developed by Anthropic and available on AWS Bedrock. It excels in complex reasoning, multimodal processing (text and images), and maintains high reliability with reduced hallucinations. The model supports 100+ languages and features a 200,000-token context window, making it suitable for sophisticated analytical tasks.",
