  "model_info": {
    "description": "Meta Llama 2 70B Chat is a 70-billion-parameter conversational AI model developed by Meta, optimized for complex dialogue and reasoning tasks. It uses an auto-regressive transformer architecture with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). The model supports a context window of approximately 8,000 tokens and is licensed for commercial and research use in English language tasks.",
