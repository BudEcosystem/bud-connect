    "description": "Cohere Embed Multilingual v3 is a multilingual embedding model developed by Cohere and available on AWS Bedrock. It generates 1,024-dimensional vector representations for text and images across 100+ languages, supporting semantic search, text classification, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The model emphasizes cross-lingual understanding, cultural context awareness, and code-switching capabilities, with a maximum input length of 2,048 characters and batch processing up to 96 texts per request.",

    "strengths": [
      "Supports 100+ languages including major business languages like English, Chinese, and Arabic, enabling global multilingual applications.",
      "Provides cross-lingual semantic similarity and cultural context understanding for consistent performance across language variations.",
      "Offers multimodal capabilities for text and image embeddings, enabling tasks like cross-lingual image search and content moderation.",
      "Optimized for efficient inference with batch processing and multiple embedding formats (float, int8, binary).",
      "Integrates seamlessly with AWS services like Amazon Kendra, Translate, and Comprehend for enterprise-scale multilingual workflows.",
      "Supports code-switching and regional language variants for mixed-language content processing."
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Performance may vary across languages, with lower accuracy for low-resource languages and regional variants.",
      "Limited input length (2,048 characters) and token count (512 tokens) may truncate complex or lengthy content.",
      "Higher computational and storage requirements due to multilingual processing complexity.",
      "Potential cultural biases in embeddings derived from training data, requiring additional validation.",
      "No streaming support for embedding generation, limiting real-time application scenarios.",
      "Regional deployment considerations for compliance with data residency and regulatory requirements."
