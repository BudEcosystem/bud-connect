    "description": "Text-embedding-ada-002 is a transformer-based embedding model developed by OpenAI, released in December 2022. It produces 1,536-dimensional normalized vectors for semantic search, clustering, and similarity tasks. While superseded by the text-embedding-3 series, it remains supported for legacy systems and applications requiring fixed-dimension embeddings.",
