    "description": "Text-embedding-3-large is OpenAI's best-performing embedding model, designed to convert text into high-dimensional vector representations (default 3,072 dimensions). It excels in semantic search, clustering, classification, and cross-lingual tasks with improved multilingual performance and flexible dimensionality adjustment. The model uses a Transformer-based architecture trained on diverse multilingual data.",
