    "description": "Azure OpenAI's GPT-4.1 series includes three variants (gpt-4.1, gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano) offering enhanced reasoning, reduced hallucinations, and cost efficiency. The full GPT-4.1 model provides a 200,000-token context window with maximum accuracy, while the mini and nano variants prioritize speed and cost optimization for high-volume and resource-constrained applications.",
