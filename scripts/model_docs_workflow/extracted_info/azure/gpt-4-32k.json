    "description": "GPT-4-32k is an extended context version of OpenAI's GPT-4 model with a 32,768 token context window (4x larger than standard GPT-4), enabling processing of approximately 50 pages of text in one pass. It supports multimodal inputs (text and images) and function calling capabilities added in June 2023. The model is deprecated and retiring in June 2025, with higher pricing ($0.06/1K input tokens, $0.12/1K output tokens) compared to newer alternatives.",
