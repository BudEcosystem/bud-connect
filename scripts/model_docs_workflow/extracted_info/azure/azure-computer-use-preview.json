    "description": "Azure OpenAI's Computer-Use Preview (CUA) is a multimodal AI model designed to interact with graphical user interfaces (GUIs), automate multi-step tasks, and execute workflows through natural language instructions. It supports screen understanding, mouse/keyboard control, application navigation, and cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux) operations with a 200,000-token context window. The model is available in a limited preview with specific regional deployments and requires Azure OpenAI resources for deployment.",

    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Automated data entry and report generation across enterprise systems",
      "End-to-end invoice processing and customer onboarding workflows",
      "UI testing, regression testing, and cross-browser compatibility checks",
      "System administration tasks like software deployment and backup operations",
      "Process documentation creation and compliance training automation"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Enables automation of complex workflows across applications with mouse, keyboard, and UI element interactions",
      "Supports cross-platform operations (Windows, macOS, Linux) and multi-monitor configurations",
      "Includes adaptive learning to improve interaction patterns and error recovery mechanisms",
      "Offers sandboxed execution and granular security controls for enterprise environments",
      "Integrates with Azure services like Logic Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft 365 for extended automation capabilities"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Limited to preview availability in select regions with potential regional restrictions",
      "Requires specific Azure infrastructure (e.g., Computer Vision API, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure)",
      "High operational costs per action ($0.05/action) and screenshot analysis ($0.02/image)",
      "Potential challenges with UI element recognition accuracy and application launch failures",
      "Dependent on Azure ecosystem integration, limiting standalone deployment flexibility"
