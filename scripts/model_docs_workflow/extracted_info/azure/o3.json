    "description": "The o3 model from OpenAI is a cutting-edge reasoning model designed for complex problem-solving and advanced reasoning tasks, particularly excelling in STEM fields. It features a 200,000-token context window, 100,000-token maximum output, and a knowledge cutoff of June 2024. The model outperforms competitors like Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro and Anthropic's Claude 4 Opus on benchmarks such as AIME 2024 and GPQA Diamond.",
