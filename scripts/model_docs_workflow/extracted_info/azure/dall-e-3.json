    "description": "DALL-E 3 is an advanced image generation model developed by OpenAI, designed to produce high-quality images with improved prompt adherence, nuanced detail, and enhanced safety measures. It supports multiple aspect ratios (1024\u00d71024, 1024\u00d71792, 1792\u00d71024), adjustable quality levels (standard/hd), and style parameters (vivid/natural). The model generates images via text prompts and outputs URLs valid for one hour.",

    "use_cases": [
      "Professional artwork and illustration creation",
      "Marketing and advertising campaign visuals",
      "Concept art and design mockups for games/media",
      "Educational materials requiring detailed imagery",
      "Social media content with custom visuals",
      "Book and magazine illustration production",
      "Product visualization and architectural renders"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Enhanced prompt understanding with automatic expansion of simple prompts for better results",
      "Native support for multiple aspect ratios and higher resolution options (up to 1792\u00d71024)",
      "Adjustable quality settings (standard/hd) to balance cost and output fidelity",
      "Style control with 'vivid' for artistic effects and 'natural' for realistic outputs",
      "Improved text rendering for generating readable text within images",
      "Integrated safety measures and content filtering for responsible use"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Limited to single-image generation (n=1) per request",
      "No support for edit/variation endpoints (unlike DALL-E 2)",
      "Generated image URLs expire after one hour",
      "Higher latency and cost for HD quality outputs (2x standard pricing)",
      "More expensive than DALL-E 2 for equivalent use cases"
