    "description": "GPT-35-Turbo is Azure OpenAI's implementation of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model, optimized for multi-turn conversations while supporting non-chat scenarios. It features version-specific context windows (4K to 16K tokens) and a training data cutoff of September 2021. The model uses Azure's deployment-based architecture with version-specific quotas and integrates with Azure AI services via the Chat Completion API.",
