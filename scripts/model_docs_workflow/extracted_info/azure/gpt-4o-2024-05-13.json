    "description": "GPT-4o-2024-05-13 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI for Azure OpenAI Service. It combines text and image processing capabilities, offering performance parity with GPT-4 Turbo in English and coding tasks while excelling in non-English languages and vision tasks. Key technical features include a 128,000-token input context window, 4,096-token output limit, and specialized image tokenization (85 tokens for low-detail images, 170 tokens per 512x512 tile for high-detail images). Training data is current through October 2023.",
