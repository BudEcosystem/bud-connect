    "description": "OpenAI o3-mini is a small reasoning model optimized for STEM tasks, offering production-ready features like function calling, structured outputs, and developer messages. It provides 200,000-token context windows, 100,000-token output limits, and three configurable reasoning effort levels (low, medium, high). The model balances speed (24% faster than o1) and cost efficiency (93% cheaper than o1) while maintaining comparable performance to larger models.",
