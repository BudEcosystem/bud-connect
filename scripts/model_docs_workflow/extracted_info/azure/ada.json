    "description": "The Ada (text-embedding-ada-002) model is a second-generation text embedding model developed by Azure OpenAI, designed for converting text into vector representations. It supports up to 8,192 tokens (v2) with fixed 1,536-dimensional outputs and training data current through September 2021. Microsoft recommends newer third-generation models (text-embedding-3) for improved multi-language performance.",
    "tags": [],
    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Text similarity comparisons for semantic analysis",
      "Document retrieval in large text corpora",
      "Clustering similar content for categorization",
      "Content-based recommendation systems",
      "Automated FAQ matching in customer support",
      "Product similarity detection in e-commerce"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Cost-effective at $0.0001 per 1,000 tokens, ideal for budget-conscious projects",
      "Efficient batch processing of up to 2,048 input items per call",
      "Reliable for standard text similarity and retrieval tasks in English",
      "Fully integrated with Azure AI Foundry Models and Embedding API",
      "Fixed 1,536-dimensional outputs ensure consistency for downstream applications"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Training data cutoff in September 2021 limits relevance to newer information",
      "Multi-language performance surpassed by newer third-generation models",
      "Fixed 1,536-dimensional outputs cannot be adjusted for specific use cases",
      "No in-place upgrades to newer models; full re-embedding required for migration",
      "Fine-tuning incurs continuous hosting costs regardless of usage"
