    "description": "GPT-4.1-nano is OpenAI's first nano-sized model, released in April 2025, offering a 1 million token context window with exceptional speed and cost efficiency. It is API-only, optimized for high-speed, cost-sensitive applications, and trained on data up to June 2024. Despite its small size, it outperforms GPT-4o-mini on benchmarks like MMLU and GPQA.",
