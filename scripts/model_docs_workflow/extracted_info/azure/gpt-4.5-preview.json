    "description": "GPT-4.5-preview is a research preview model developed by OpenAI as their largest and best chat-focused model at release (late 2024). It was deprecated in July 2025 in favor of the more efficient GPT-4.1 family. The model featured a compute-intensive architecture for experimentation but had a smaller context window than GPT-4.1 and was removed from the API.",
