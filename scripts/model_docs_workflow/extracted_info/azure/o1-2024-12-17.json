    "description": "The o1-2024-12-17 model is a multimodal reasoning model developed by Azure OpenAI, released on December 17, 2024. It supports text and vision inputs with a 200K token context window (128K input) and a knowledge cutoff of October 2023. Key features include developer messages, configurable reasoning effort (low/medium/high), and tools support for agentic AI applications.",
