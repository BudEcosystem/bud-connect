    "description": "GPT-4o Realtime Preview (2024-10-01) is a multimodal AI model developed by Azure OpenAI Service for low-latency, real-time audio and text interactions. It supports speech-to-speech conversational capabilities with text message integration, optimized for sub-second response times and multi-turn dialogue. The model is in preview status and not recommended for production use, with technical limitations including no image modality support.",

      "Conversational AI prototyping and research applications"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Enables real-time speech input and output with sub-second latency for conversational interactions",
      "Supports WebRTC integration for browser-based audio streaming and WebSocket-based bidirectional communication",
      "Maintains conversational context across multi-turn dialogues with minimal delay",
      "Offers 8 distinct voice options (e.g., 'alloy', 'ash') for natural-sounding audio synthesis",
      "Provides high-quality audio output with minimal artifacts and natural speech patterns"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Preview status - not optimized for production traffic or enterprise workloads",
      "No image modality support (unlike standard GPT-4o) despite being a multimodal model",
      "Rate limits restricted to 100,000 TPM and 1,000 RPM for test/development only",
      "Lacks structured outputs feature and has no function tool calling capabilities",
      "Data storage of prompts/completions enabled by default with abuse monitoring",
      "API version subject to change with potential deprecation risks"
