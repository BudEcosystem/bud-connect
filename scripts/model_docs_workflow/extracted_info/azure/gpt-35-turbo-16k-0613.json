    "description": "GPT-35-Turbo-16K-0613 is a version of Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model with a 16,384-token context window, released on June 13, 2023. It supports function calling, maintains GPT-3.5 capabilities, and uses training data up to September 2021. The model was retired on October 1, 2024, and is no longer available for new deployments.",

    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Processing long documents (e.g., legal contracts, research papers)",
      "Extended customer support conversations with context retention",
      "Function-enabled automation (e.g., API integration, data retrieval)",
      "Educational tutoring with multi-turn interactions",
      "Technical documentation analysis and summarization"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Extended 16K token context window for handling long documents and conversations",
      "Supports function calling with structured parameter extraction and single-function execution",
      "Stable snapshot version (June 13, 2023) ensures consistent behavior",
      "Azure OpenAI service integration with Chat Completions API compatibility",
      "Balanced performance across extended context windows with coherent outputs"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Retired as of October 1, 2024, requiring migration to newer models",
      "Not recommended to exceed 4,096 input tokens despite 16K context capacity",
      "Limited to basic single-function calling (no parallel function support)",
      "Training data cutoff in September 2021 limits modern knowledge",
      "Higher cost compared to standard GPT-3.5-Turbo due to extended context",
      "Context quality may degrade beyond 4,096 tokens"
