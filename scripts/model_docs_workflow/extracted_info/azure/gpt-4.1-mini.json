    "description": "GPT-4.1-mini is a fast, efficient small model in the GPT-4.1 family developed by OpenAI, offering significant improvements over GPT-4o mini in instruction-following, coding, and overall intelligence. It features a 1 million token context window (matching GPT-4.1), a June 2024 knowledge cutoff, and 83% lower cost compared to GPT-4o. Despite its 'mini' designation, it outperforms GPT-4o in many benchmarks while maintaining low latency.",
