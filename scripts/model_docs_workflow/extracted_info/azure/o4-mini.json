    "description": "OpenAI o4-mini is a cost-efficient, smaller model optimized for fast reasoning in math, coding, and visual tasks. It features a 200,000-token context window, 100,000-token output limit, and native multimodal support for text and images. The model integrates Python interpreter access and web browsing, achieving 99.5% pass@1 on AIME 2025 and state-of-the-art performance on Codeforces and SWE-bench. It offers 10x cost reduction compared to o3 models while maintaining strong performance across STEM and visual domains.",
