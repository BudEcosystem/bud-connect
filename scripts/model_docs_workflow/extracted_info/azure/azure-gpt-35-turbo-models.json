    "description": "Azure OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo models are cost-effective, fast language models optimized for chat and traditional completion tasks. They include two variants: gpt-35-turbo (4,096 token context window) and gpt-35-turbo-16k (16,384 token context window), with the latter designed for longer conversations and documents. These models balance performance and cost, supporting regional deployments for compliance and data residency requirements.",
