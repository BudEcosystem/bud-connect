    "description": "GPT-4o mini is a cost-efficient small language model developed by OpenAI, designed for high-volume, cost-sensitive applications. It features a 128,000-token context window, 16,384-token output limit, and improved non-English text handling via a shared tokenizer with GPT-4o. The model supports text and vision processing, with upcoming audio/video capabilities, and includes enhanced safety features like resistance to jailbreaks and prompt injections.",
