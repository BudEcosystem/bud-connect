  "model_info": {
    "description": "GPT-4o-2024-08-06 is an advanced multimodal large language model developed by Azure OpenAI Service. It offers enhanced structured output capabilities, increased token limits (128,000 input tokens and 16,384 output tokens), and significant cost reductions compared to its predecessor. The model maintains multimodal text and image processing while introducing features like JSON Schema support and improved performance benchmarks.",
