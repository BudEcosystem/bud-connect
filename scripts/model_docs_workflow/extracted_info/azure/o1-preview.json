  "model_info": {
    "description": "OpenAI o1-preview is an advanced AI model designed to enhance reasoning capabilities for complex problems in science, coding, and mathematics. It uses transformer architecture with reinforcement learning and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, featuring a 128,000-token context window and 32,768-token output limit. The model's knowledge is current as of October 1, 2023, and it processes text-only inputs with a slower response time (17.03 seconds TTFT) due to its internal reasoning process.",
    "tags": [],
    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Solving complex mathematical problems requiring step-by-step reasoning (e.g., IMO-level challenges).",
      "Advanced coding tasks, including code generation and debugging for competitive programming.",
      "Scientific research applications such as physics formula generation and healthcare data annotation.",
      "Educational tools requiring detailed, accurate explanations for STEM subjects.",
      "High-accuracy workflows where reasoning depth outweighs the need for speed."
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Excels in mathematics with an 83% score on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam, significantly outperforming GPT-4o (13%).",
      "Achieves 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions and demonstrates strong coding performance on HumanEval benchmarks.",
      "Leverages reinforcement learning to navigate complex reasoning tasks without fixating on failed paths, improving data efficiency.",
      "Scores 84 on the hardest jailbreaking tests, showing advanced resistance to manipulation compared to GPT-4o (22/100).",
      "Leads in general performance on the MMLU benchmark and excels in precise instruction following and Spanish-language fluency."
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "High cost with input tokens at $15.00 per 1M and output tokens at $60.00 per 1M, significantly more expensive than GPT-4o.",
      "Lacks support for images, web browsing, file uploads, and multimodal input/output during the beta phase.",
      "Slower response times (17.03 seconds TTFT) due to internal reasoning process, making it unsuitable for low-latency tasks.",
      "Beta phase restrictions include no streaming, function calling, or system messages, and limited API access (50 queries/week).",
      "Reasoning tokens consume context window space and billing costs without being visible to users."
