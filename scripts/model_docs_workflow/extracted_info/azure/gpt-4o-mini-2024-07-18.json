    "description": "GPT-4o Mini is a compact, cost-efficient small language model (SLM) developed by OpenAI, released on July 18, 2024. It features a 128,000-token context window, 16,384-token output limit, and a knowledge cutoff of October 1, 2023. Built on a streamlined GPT-4o architecture, it supports text and vision processing with plans for future audio/video capabilities. The model is optimized for high-volume, performance-sensitive applications while maintaining multilingual support and core functionalities.",
