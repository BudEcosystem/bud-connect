    "description": "Azure OpenAI's o-series reasoning models are advanced AI systems designed for complex problem-solving, featuring enhanced reasoning, multi-step processing, and chain-of-thought capabilities. These models excel in mathematical, scientific, and analytical tasks, with varying context windows (128k\u2013200k tokens) and specialized features like visual analysis (o3) and cost efficiency (o4-mini).",
