    "description": "Claude 3 Haiku (20240307) is a compact, multimodal large language model developed by Anthropic, designed for rapid, cost-effective AI responses. It features a 200,000-token context window, 4,096-token output limit, and processes 10k tokens in under 3 seconds. Optimized for speed and affordability, it supports text and vision inputs while maintaining core capabilities for high-volume applications.",

    "tasks": [],
    "use_cases": [
      "Real-time customer support and live chat applications",
      "High-volume content moderation and classification",
      "Quick information retrieval and document summarization",
      "Code completion and syntax validation in development tools",
      "Edge computing scenarios requiring low-latency responses"
    ],
    "strengths": [
      "Fastest model in the Claude 3 family with sub-3-second processing for 10k tokens",
      "60x cheaper than Claude 3 Opus with entry-level pricing for high-volume use cases",
      "Full multimodal support for text and vision processing",
      "Minimal first-token latency and optimized streaming for real-time interactions",
      "High throughput and low-latency performance for concurrent request handling"
    ],
    "limitations": [
      "Less sophisticated reasoning compared to larger Claude 3 models (Sonnet/Opus)",
      "Struggles with complex multi-step tasks and nuanced content",
      "Knowledge cutoff in August 2023 with no internet access",
      "Limited to 4,096-token outputs and 200,000-token context window",
      "Best suited for simple, well-defined tasks rather than advanced reasoning"
