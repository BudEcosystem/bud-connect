    "description": "Claude 3 Opus is Anthropic's most powerful model in the Claude 3 generation, designed for complex tasks requiring deep analysis, nuanced understanding, and sophisticated reasoning. It features a 200,000-token context window, 4,096-token output limit, and multimodal support (text and vision). The model outperforms peers on benchmarks like MMLU (undergraduate knowledge), GPQA (graduate reasoning), and GSM8K (mathematics), with industry-leading performance at release.",
