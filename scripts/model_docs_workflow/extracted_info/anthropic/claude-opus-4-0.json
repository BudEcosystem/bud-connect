    "description": "Claude Opus 4.0 is Anthropic's most advanced model, launched on May 22, 2025, excelling in coding, agentic search, and creative writing. It features a 32K token output capacity, extended task duration (hours), and hybrid reasoning architecture with tool integration. The model achieves 72.5% on SWE-bench and 43.2% on Terminal-bench, with capabilities for thousands of coherent steps in complex tasks.",

    "strengths": [
      "World's best coding performance with 72.5% on SWE-bench and 43.2% on Terminal-bench",
      "Handles extended tasks (hours) with sustained performance and thousands of coherent steps",
      "Hybrid reasoning architecture supports instant responses or deep, step-by-step thinking",

    "limitations": [
      "Higher cost compared to other models ($15/input, $75/output per million tokens)",
      "Extended thinking increases latency and requires careful cost management",
      "Best suited for complex, high-value tasks rather than simple queries",
      "Requires versioned model IDs for production stability"
