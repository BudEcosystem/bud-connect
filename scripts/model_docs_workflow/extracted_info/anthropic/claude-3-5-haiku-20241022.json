    "description": "Claude 3.5 Haiku (20241022) is a speed-optimized multimodal large language model developed by Anthropic, released on October 22, 2024. It surpasses Claude 3 Opus on many intelligence benchmarks while maintaining sub-second response times, with a 200,000 token context window and 8,192 token output limit. The model supports text and vision inputs and excels in coding tasks with a 40.6% success rate on SWE-bench Verified.",
