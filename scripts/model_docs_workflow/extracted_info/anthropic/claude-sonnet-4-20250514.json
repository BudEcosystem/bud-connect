    "description": "Claude Sonnet 4 (20250514) is a production-ready hybrid reasoning model developed by Anthropic, optimized for coding and reasoning tasks with a 200,000 token context window. It offers advanced tool integration, reduced error rates (65% lower than Sonnet 3.7), and cost efficiency (5x cheaper than Opus 4). The model excels in software development workflows and complex problem-solving with extended thinking modes.",
