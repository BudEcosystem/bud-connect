    "description": "Claude 3.5 Sonnet (20240620) is a transformer-based, multimodal large language model developed by Anthropic, launched on June 20, 2024. It features a 200,000-token context window, 4,096-token output (8,192 in beta), and excels in vision tasks, coding (64% success rate on internal agentic coding evaluation), and graduate-level reasoning. It operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus while maintaining cost efficiency.",
