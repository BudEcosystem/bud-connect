    "description": "Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic's most intelligent hybrid reasoning model as of February 2025, designed for advanced coding and reasoning tasks. It features dual-mode operation (standard LLM and extended thinking mode), a 128K-token output limit (via beta header), and a knowledge cutoff of October 2024. The model excels in software development, complex problem-solving, and multi-step reasoning.",
