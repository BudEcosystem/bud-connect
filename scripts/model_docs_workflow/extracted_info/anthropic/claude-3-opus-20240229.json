    "description": "Claude 3 Opus (20240229) is the flagship model of the Claude 3 family, developed by Anthropic. Released on February 29, 2024, it features a 200,000-token context window, 4,096-token output limit, and multimodal support for text and vision. Trained on data up to August 2023, it excels at complex cognitive tasks with near-human understanding and fluency.",

    "limitations": [
      "200,000-token context window and 4,096-token output limit restrict handling of extremely large inputs/outputs",
      "No internet access or real-time data capabilities, with knowledge cutoff at August 2023",
      "Higher latency and cost compared to Claude 3 Sonnet/Haiku variants (2.5x input cost, 5x output cost)",
      "Resource-intensive processing makes it overkill for simple tasks",
      "Cannot execute code or interact with external systems"
