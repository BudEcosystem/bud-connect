    "description": "Claude 3.7 Sonnet Latest (claude-3-7-sonnet-latest) is a development-focused alias maintained by Anthropic that automatically points to the most recent version of Claude 3.7 Sonnet. It provides access to the latest updates, including hybrid reasoning capabilities, 128K token output support (beta), and state-of-the-art coding performance. Designed for non-production use, it shares technical specifications with the current versioned model (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219) but is not recommended for mission-critical applications due to potential behavior changes from automatic updates.",
