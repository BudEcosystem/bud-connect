    "description": "Claude Sonnet 4.0 is a hybrid reasoning model developed by Anthropic, offering advanced coding and reasoning capabilities while maintaining cost-effectiveness. It features a 200K token context window, dual-mode reasoning (instant or extended thinking), and parallel tool execution. The model excels in software development, AI agent workflows, and knowledge processing tasks.",
