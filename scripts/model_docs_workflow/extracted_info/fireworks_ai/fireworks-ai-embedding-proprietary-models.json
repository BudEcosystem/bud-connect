    "description": "Fireworks AI offers two proprietary embedding models optimized for high-scale text processing and semantic understanding. The 'fireworks-ai-embedding-up-to-150m' handles up to 150 million tokens, while the 'fireworks-ai-embedding-150m-to-350m' supports 150-350 million tokens. Both are OpenAI-compatible, designed for enterprise applications requiring high throughput, and feature fast inference for similarity comparisons and RAG pipelines.",
