    "description": "The GTE (General Text Embeddings) models, developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy, are BERT-based text embedding models trained using multi-stage contrastive learning on large-scale relevance text pairs. The gte-base variant has ~110M parameters and 768 dimensions, while gte-large has 335M parameters and 1024 dimensions. Both support 512-token context lengths and outperform models like OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 in efficiency and performance.",

    "strengths": [
      "gte-base outperforms text-embedding-ada-002 with 10x fewer parameters, achieving exceptional performance-to-size ratio",

    "limitations": [
      "512-token context length limits handling of long documents",
      "Primarily optimized for English texts with potential limitations in other languages",
      "Training data has temporal cutoff, affecting relevance to recent developments",
      "gte-base may lack precision for complex tasks compared to gte-large",
      "Not suitable for real-time streaming applications due to fixed context window"
