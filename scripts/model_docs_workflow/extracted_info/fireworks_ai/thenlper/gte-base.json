    "description": "The thenlper/gte-base is a BERT-based text embedding model developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy, optimized for information retrieval and semantic similarity tasks. It features a 768-dimensional embedding space, 512-token context window, and 0.22 GB model size. Trained on a large-scale corpus of text pairs across diverse domains, it excels in semantic textual similarity (82.3 MTEB score) and classification tasks while maintaining efficiency for practical deployment.",
