    "description": "WhereIsAI/UAE-Large-V1 is a state-of-the-art text embedding model developed by WhereIsAI, achieving SOTA performance on the MTEB Leaderboard with an average score of 64.64. It uses a BERT-based architecture (110M parameters) with 'cls' pooling and a 512-token context window, optimized for universal NLP tasks through angle-optimized loss in complex space. The model is MIT-licensed and supports OpenAI-compatible API integration.",
