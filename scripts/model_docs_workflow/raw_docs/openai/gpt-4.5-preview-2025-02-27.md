# GPT-4.5 Preview (2025-02-27)

## Model Overview

GPT-4.5 is OpenAI's research preview of their "largest and best model for chat yet" that represents "a step forward in scaling up pre-training and post-training." Characterized as "A research preview of our strongest GPT model," it's available to Pro users and developers worldwide. GPT-4.5, internally code-named "Orion," was trained using more computing power and data than any of OpenAI's previous releases.

## Technical Specifications

### Context and Token Limits
- **Context Window**: 128,000 tokens (same as GPT-4o)
- **Input Types**: Text and image (same as GPT-4o)
- **Training Cutoff**: October 2023 (same as GPT-4o)

### Architecture and Training
- Built using scaled unsupervised learning with increased compute and data
- Incorporates architecture and optimization innovations
- Trained on Microsoft Azure AI supercomputers
- Described as "(probably) the largest model in the world" by OpenAI's Rapha Gontijo Lopes
- Performance is characterized as "weirdly slow" due to its massive size

## Capabilities and Features

### Enhanced Understanding and "EQ"
- Improved understanding of what humans mean with greater nuance and "EQ"
- Better interpretation of subtle cues and implicit expectations
- More natural interaction experience compared to previous models
- Enhanced ability to follow user intent

### Broader Knowledge Base
- Expanded knowledge base compared to previous models
- Improved performance across a wide range of topics
- Better reliability and accuracy in responses

### Reduced Hallucinations
- Demonstrated lower hallucination rates than GPT-4o and o1 models in testing
- More reliable across diverse topics due to deeper understanding of the world

### General Purpose Intelligence
- Unlike reasoning models (o1 series), GPT-4.5 doesn't "think before it responds"
- More general-purpose, innately smarter model compared to reasoning models
- Excellent for tasks requiring immediate responses without extended reasoning

## Pricing Information

### API Pricing
- **Input Tokens**: $75 per million tokens (roughly 750,000 words)
- **Output Tokens**: $150 per million tokens
- One of OpenAI's most expensive offerings

### Pricing Comparison
- GPT-4.5: $75/$150 per million tokens
- o1: $15/$60 per million tokens  
- GPT-4o: $2.50/$10 per million tokens

## API Usage Details

### Model Identifier
- Model name: `gpt-4.5-preview-2025-02-27`
- Available through OpenAI API platform

### Performance Characteristics
- Slower response times due to model size
- Extremely expensive to run operationally
- High computational requirements

## Performance Benchmarks

While specific benchmark scores weren't provided in the search results, the model is positioned as:
- OpenAI's "strongest GPT model"
- Superior performance compared to GPT-4o in general intelligence tasks
- Better at following user intent and providing nuanced responses

## Use Cases and Applications

### Optimal Use Cases
- Complex writing tasks requiring nuanced understanding
- Programming assistance with sophisticated code generation
- Problem-solving requiring broad knowledge and deep understanding
- Tasks requiring high "EQ" and interpretation of subtle human cues

### Recommended For
- Applications where cost is less important than maximum capability
- Use cases requiring the most advanced general-purpose AI
- Tasks that benefit from reduced hallucinations and improved reliability

## Limitations and Considerations

### Cost Limitations
- Extremely high operational costs make it unsuitable for high-volume applications
- Most expensive model in OpenAI's lineup

### Performance Trade-offs
- Slower response times compared to smaller models
- May be overkill for simple tasks that could be handled by less expensive models

### Availability Constraints
- Research preview status indicates potential instability
- Limited long-term availability due to operational costs

## Availability and Access

### Current Access
- Available to ChatGPT Pro subscribers ($200/month)
- Available to developers through the API
- Rolling out to ChatGPT Plus and Team subscribers
- Later availability for ChatGPT Edu and Enterprise subscribers

### Deprecation Timeline
- **Important**: OpenAI announced plans to wind down GPT-4.5 API access
- **Deprecation Date**: July 14, 2025
- Developers must transition to other models after this date
- GPT-4.5 Preview will be turned off to manage operational costs

## Important Notes

### Operational Challenges
- Described as extremely expensive to run by OpenAI
- Company evaluating long-term viability due to costs
- May not be sustainable for widespread deployment

### Strategic Position
- Represents peak general-purpose AI capability as of early 2025
- Demonstrates scaling benefits of increased compute and data
- Bridge between current models and future developments

### Migration Planning
- Users should plan transition to alternative models before July 2025 deprecation
- Consider cost-benefit analysis when choosing between GPT-4.5 and other options
- GPT-4o or o1 models may be more practical for most use cases
