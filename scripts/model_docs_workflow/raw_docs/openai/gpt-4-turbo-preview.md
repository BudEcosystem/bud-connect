# GPT-4 Turbo Preview

## Model Overview

GPT-4 Turbo Preview is the next generation model after GPT-4, designed to provide enhanced capabilities with a significantly larger context window and more recent knowledge cutoff. This model represents a major advancement in OpenAI's language model offerings, combining improved performance with greater cost efficiency.

## Technical Specifications

### Context Window
- **Maximum context length**: 128,000 tokens
- Can process the equivalent of more than 300 pages of text in a single prompt
- Significantly larger than the standard GPT-4 context window

### Knowledge Cutoff
- Knowledge of world events up to April 2023
- More recent than the original GPT-4 model

### Model Identifier
- API model name: `gpt-4-1106-preview`
- Also accessible via `gpt-4-turbo` for the most recent version

## Capabilities

### Core Features
- Advanced natural language understanding and generation
- Complex reasoning and problem-solving abilities
- Code generation and analysis
- Creative writing and content creation
- Multilingual support

### Vision Capabilities
- Vision features available through `gpt-4-vision-preview` model variant
- Can analyze and understand images alongside text inputs

## Pricing

GPT-4 Turbo offers significant cost savings compared to the original GPT-4:

### Token Pricing
- **Input tokens**: $10.00 per 1 million tokens ($0.01 per 1K tokens)
- **Output tokens**: $30.00 per 1 million tokens ($0.03 per 1K tokens)

### Cost Comparison
- 3x cheaper for input tokens compared to GPT-4
- 2x cheaper for output tokens compared to GPT-4

## API Usage

### Basic Request Example
```python
import openai

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-4-1106-preview",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your question here"}
    ],
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### Access Requirements
- OpenAI API account required
- Existing GPT-4 access enables automatic access to GPT-4 Turbo
- Available to all paying developers

## Use Cases

### Ideal Applications
- Document analysis and summarization (leveraging the 128k context window)
- Long-form content generation
- Complex multi-step reasoning tasks
- Code review and generation for large codebases
- Research and academic applications
- Business intelligence and data analysis

### Advantages Over GPT-4
- Process much longer documents and conversations
- More cost-effective for high-volume applications
- More recent knowledge base
- Better suited for applications requiring extensive context

## Limitations

### Current Constraints
- Still in preview phase (as indicated by model name)
- May have occasional inconsistencies compared to stable releases
- Vision capabilities require separate model variant
- Token limits still apply despite larger context window

### Considerations
- While more affordable than GPT-4, costs can still accumulate with heavy usage
- The 128k context window may not be fully utilized in all applications
- Performance may vary depending on the specific task and prompt engineering

## Best Practices

### Optimization Tips
1. Utilize the large context window for complex, multi-document tasks
2. Take advantage of the cost savings for high-volume applications
3. Use appropriate prompt engineering to maximize model performance
4. Consider using GPT-4 Turbo for tasks that benefit from recent knowledge

### When to Use GPT-4 Turbo Preview
- When you need to process long documents or maintain extensive conversation history
- For applications requiring knowledge up to April 2023
- When cost optimization is important for your use case
- For testing and development of applications that will use future GPT-4 Turbo releases

## Availability

- Released at OpenAI DevDay in November 2023
- Available through OpenAI API
- Accessible to all developers with GPT-4 access
- Continuously updated with improvements and bug fixes

## Future Developments

As a preview model, GPT-4 Turbo Preview is expected to:
- Receive regular updates and improvements
- Eventually transition to a stable release
- Potentially increase context window size in future iterations
- Continue to improve in performance and efficiency
