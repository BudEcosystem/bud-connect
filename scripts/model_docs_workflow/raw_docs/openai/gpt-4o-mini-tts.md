## Comparison with Other TTS

### vs Traditional TTS
| Feature | GPT-4o-mini-tts | Traditional TTS |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Voice Control | Natural language | Parameters only |
| Flexibility | High | Limited |
| Emotion Range | Extensive | Basic |
| Customization | Per-request | Pre-configured |
| Learning Curve | Intuitive | Technical |

### vs GPT-4o-tts (if available)
- More efficient processing

- Slightly reduced quality
- Faster generation times
- Better for high-volume use

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Voice Switching
```python
# Different instructions for different parts
parts = [
    ("Welcome everyone!", "Enthusiastic host"),
    ("Today's topic is serious.", "Somber, thoughtful"),
    ("But first, a joke!", "Playful and light")
]

for text, instruction in parts:
    response = openai.Audio.create_speech(
        model="gpt-4o-mini-tts",
        voice="fable",
        input=text,
        instructions=instruction
    )
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Process multiple texts efficiently
texts = ["Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3"]
instruction = "Professional narrator"

audio_files = []
for i, text in enumerate(texts):
    response = openai.Audio.create_speech(
        model="gpt-4o-mini-tts",
        voice="onyx",
        input=text,
        instructions=instruction
    )
    audio_files.append(response.content)
```

## Integration Patterns

### Streaming Applications
```python
# Conceptual streaming implementation
async def stream_tts(text_generator, instructions):
    async for text_chunk in text_generator:
        audio = await openai.Audio.create_speech_async(
            model="gpt-4o-mini-tts",
            voice="echo",
            input=text_chunk,
            instructions=instructions,
            stream=True
        )
        yield audio
```
