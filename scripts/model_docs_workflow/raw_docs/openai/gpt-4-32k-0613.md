# GPT-4-32k-0613 Model Documentation

## Model Overview
GPT-4-32k-0613 is a specific variant of OpenAI's GPT-4 large language model with an extended context window, released on June 13, 2023. This model was designed to handle larger amounts of text input compared to standard GPT-4 models while maintaining the same core capabilities and improvements introduced in the 0613 model series.

## Technical Specifications

### Context Window
- **Context Length**: 32,768 tokens (32k tokens)
- **Architecture**: GPT-4 based with extended context capabilities
- **Model Type**: Large Language Model (LLM)

### Key Features
- Extended context window for processing lengthy documents
- Improved coherence across long-form text
- Maintains thematic consistency throughout extended interactions
- Same base capabilities as GPT-4-0613 with enhanced context handling

## Release Information

### Release Details
- **Release Date**: June 13, 2023
- **Model Version**: gpt-4-32k-0613
- **Successor to**: gpt-4-32k-0314 (deprecated)
- **Model Family**: GPT-4 series

### Version Context
The 0613 series represented a significant update from the 0314 models, introducing function calling capabilities and various performance improvements while extending the deprecation timeline for legacy models.

## Pricing (Current as of 2025)

### Token Costs
- **Input Tokens**: $60.00 per 1 million tokens ($0.06 per 1,000 tokens)
- **Output Tokens**: $120.00 per 1 million tokens ($0.12 per 1,000 tokens)

### Cost Comparison
- **vs. Standard GPT-4**: 2x more expensive due to extended context window
- **vs. GPT-4o**: Significantly more expensive (GPT-4o: $5/1M input, $20/1M output)
- **Cost Justification**: Higher pricing reflects increased computational resources required for 32k context processing

## Capabilities

### Function Calling Support
- **Function Calling**: ✅ **Supported**
- **JSON Output**: Can intelligently output JSON objects containing function arguments
- **Structured Data**: Reliably returns structured data following function signatures
- **API Integration**: Enhanced ability to connect with external tools and APIs
- **Detection**: Automatically detects when function calls are needed based on user input

### Vision Capabilities
- **Vision Support**: ❌ **Not Supported**
- **Image Processing**: No image analysis or visual input capabilities
- **Text Only**: Limited to text-based inputs and outputs
- **Note**: Vision capabilities were introduced in later model versions (GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, GPT-4o)

### Core Language Capabilities
- **Text Generation**: Advanced natural language generation
- **Text Analysis**: Comprehensive text understanding and analysis
- **Code Generation**: Programming language support and code completion
- **Reasoning**: Complex logical reasoning and problem-solving
- **Multilingual**: Support for multiple languages
- **Long-form Content**: Optimized for extended document processing

## Use Cases

### Optimal Applications
- **Document Analysis**: Processing and analyzing lengthy documents (up to 32k tokens)
- **Technical Documentation**: Creating comprehensive technical documents
- **Content Creation**: Long-form content requiring extensive context maintenance
- **Code Analysis**: Reviewing large codebases within context limits
- **Research**: Academic and professional research requiring context retention

### Infrastructure Considerations
- **Computational Requirements**: Higher resource demands than standard GPT-4
- **Response Time**: Potentially longer processing times due to extended context
- **Cost Management**: Requires careful budgeting due to premium pricing
- **Server Capacity**: Infrastructure must accommodate increased memory and processing needs

## Current Status and Deprecation

### Availability Status
- **Current Status**: Still available as of 2025
- **API Access**: Accessible through OpenAI API
- **Deprecation Notice**: No specific deprecation date found in current documentation
- **Support**: Continued support with regular maintenance

### Migration Considerations
- **Recommended Alternative**: GPT-4o offers 128k context (4x larger) at significantly lower cost
- **Performance**: GPT-4o is 2x faster with multimodal capabilities
- **Cost Efficiency**: GPT-4o provides better value proposition for most use cases
- **Future Planning**: Consider migration to newer models for long-term projects

## API Integration

### Model Identifier
```
Model Name: gpt-4-32k-0613
API Endpoint: /v1/chat/completions
```

### Request Parameters
- **model**: "gpt-4-32k-0613"
- **max_tokens**: Up to 32,768 tokens total (including input and output)
- **functions**: Supported for function calling
- **temperature**: 0.0 to 2.0 (creativity control)

### Best Practices
- **Token Management**: Monitor token usage carefully due to high costs
- **Context Optimization**: Utilize the full 32k context window efficiently
- **Function Calling**: Leverage built-in function calling for structured outputs
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for API requests

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- **No Vision**: Cannot process images or visual content
- **Context Limit**: Hard limit of 32,768 tokens
- **Processing Speed**: Slower than newer models due to architecture
- **Cost**: Premium pricing may limit usage for high-volume applications

### Recommended Alternatives
- **GPT-4o**: For vision capabilities and cost efficiency
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: For larger context windows (128k tokens)
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: For cost-sensitive applications with smaller context needs
