## GPT-4-32k-0314 Model Documentation

### Model Overview
GPT-4-32k-0314 is a specific snapshot version of OpenAI's GPT-4 model with extended context length, released on March 14, 2023. The "0314" suffix indicates this is a fixed snapshot from that date, meaning it does not receive updates unlike the main GPT-4 model.

### Technical Specifications

**Context Length**: 32,768 tokens (approximately 50 pages of text)
**Model Type**: Large language model (text input/output only)
**API Compatibility**: Chat Completions API only
**Token Limits**: 
- Input + Output tokens combined cannot exceed 32,768 tokens
- tokens_per_message = 3
- tokens_per_name = 1

**Rate Limits**:
- Tokens Per Minute (TPM): 80,000
- Requests Per Minute (RPM): 400

### Release Information

**Release Date**: March 14, 2023 (NOT 2024)
**Version**: 0314 snapshot
**Model Family**: GPT-4 with extended context

### Pricing (Historical)

**Input Tokens**: $60.00 per 1 million tokens ($0.06 per 1K tokens)
**Output Tokens**: $120.00 per 1 million tokens ($0.12 per 1K tokens)

*Note: This is significantly higher than base GPT-4 due to the extended context length*

### Capabilities and Limitations

**Function Calling**: ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED**
- Function calling was introduced later with GPT-4-0613 and GPT-3.5-turbo-0613
- GPT-4-32k-0314 predates this capability

**Vision Capabilities**: ❌ **NOT SUPPORTED**  
- No multimodal/image processing capabilities
- Text input and output only
- Vision capabilities came with later models like GPT-4V and GPT-4 Turbo

**Supported Features**:
- Extended 32K context window for long-form content processing
- Chat-based conversation format
- Text generation and comprehension
- Code generation and analysis
- Complex reasoning tasks

### Deprecation Status

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **DEPRECATED**

**Timeline**:
- Originally scheduled for sunset: September 13, 2023
- Extended support period: Until June 13, 2024 (based on developer feedback)  
- **Current Status (2025)**: Model is no longer available for new usage
- Final deprecation: October 1, 2024
- Retirement date: June 6, 2025

### Migration Recommendations

**Recommended Alternatives**:
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: For extended context needs with multimodal capabilities
- **GPT-4-0613 or later**: For function calling requirements  
- **GPT-4o**: For current generation capabilities with improved performance
- **Custom GPT-4**: For applications requiring the latest model improvements

### Usage Notes

- This was a snapshot model that did not receive updates after March 14, 2023
- Developers needed to explicitly specify "gpt-4-32k-0314" in API calls to use this version
- The model was part of OpenAI's early GPT-4 release strategy before standardizing on continuously updated models
- Access was initially limited and required approval through OpenAI's waitlist system

### Important Disclaimers

1. **No March 2024 Release**: There was no GPT-4-32k-0314 variant released on March 14, 2024. The model dates to March 14, 2023.
2. **Limited Availability**: This model had restricted access and is now fully deprecated.
3. **No Modern Features**: Lacks function calling, vision, and other capabilities found in newer GPT-4 variants.

This model served as an important stepping stone in OpenAI's GPT-4 rollout, providing extended context capabilities before the introduction of more advanced features in subsequent releases.
