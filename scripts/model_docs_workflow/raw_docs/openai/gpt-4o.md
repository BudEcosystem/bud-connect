## API Usage Examples

### Basic Text Usage
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing"}
  ]
)
```

### Vision Capabilities
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
```

### Function Calling
```python
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get weather information",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4o",
  messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in San Francisco?"}],
  tools=tools
)
```

## Use Cases and Applications

### General Applications
- Complex reasoning and analysis tasks
- Code generation and debugging
- Content creation and editing
- Data analysis and interpretation
- Multi-step problem solving
- Creative writing and ideation

### Specialized Use Cases
- **Vision**: Image analysis, document processing, chart interpretation
- **Multimodal**: Combining text and visual inputs for comprehensive analysis
- **Real-time Applications**: Chat applications with streaming responses
- **Enterprise**: Business analysis, report generation, customer service

## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Limitations
- Knowledge cutoff: October 2023
- Context limit: 128K tokens total (input + output)
- Audio capabilities still in preview/development
- No direct file upload (images must be via URL or base64)

### Usage Considerations
- Token usage includes both input and output
- Vision processing may use more tokens for complex images
- Function calling adds to token consumption
- Rate limits apply based on usage tier

## Best Practices

### Optimization Tips
1. Use clear, specific prompts for better results
2. Leverage structured outputs for consistent formatting
3. Combine text and vision inputs effectively
4. Use function calling for external data integration
5. Implement proper error handling for API calls

### Cost Management
1. Monitor token usage carefully
2. Use streaming for better user experience
3. Implement caching for repeated queries
4. Consider batch processing for large volumes
5. Optimize prompt length without sacrificing clarity
