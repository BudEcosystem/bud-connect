## API Usage

### Basic Request Example
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
    headers={
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    },
    json={
        "model": "gpt-4o-search-preview",
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What are the latest developments in AI?"
            }
        ],
        "web_search_options": {
            "enabled": true,
            "user_location": {
                "city": "San Francisco",
                "country": "USA"
            }
        }
    }
)
```

### Web Search Options
```json
{
    "web_search_options": {
        "search_context_size": "low",
        "user_location": {
            "type": "approximate",
            "approximate": {
                "city": "text",
                "country": "text",
                "region": "text",
                "timezone": "text"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
