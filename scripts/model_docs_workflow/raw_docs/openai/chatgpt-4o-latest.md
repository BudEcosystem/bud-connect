3. Keep the API key secure (non-recoverable)
4. Integrate into your application

### Basic API Example
```python
import openai

# Set up your API key
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Make a request
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="chatgpt-4o-latest",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}
    ],
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Multimodal request with image
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="chatgpt-4o-latest",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"}}
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```
