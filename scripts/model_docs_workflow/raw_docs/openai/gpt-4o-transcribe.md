## API Usage

### REST API Example
```python
import openai

# Note: Direct audio API may not be available yet
# This is a conceptual example
response = openai.Audio.transcribe(
    model="gpt-4o-transcribe",
    file=open("audio_file.mp3", "rb"),
    language="en",
    response_format="json"
)

print(response.text)
```

### Real-Time WebSocket Example
```python
import websocket
import json

def on_message(ws, message):
    data = json.loads(message)
    if data['type'] == 'transcription':
        print(f"Transcription: {data['text']}")

ws = websocket.WebSocketApp(
    "wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime",
    on_message=on_message
)

# Send audio configuration
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "type": "configure",
    "model": "gpt-4o-transcribe",
    "input_audio_settings": {
        "format": "pcm16",
        "sample_rate": 24000
    }
}))
```
