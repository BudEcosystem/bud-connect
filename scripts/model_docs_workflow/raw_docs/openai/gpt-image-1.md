|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Low | $0.01 | ~$0.02 |
| Medium | $0.04 | ~$0.07 |
| High | $0.17 | ~$0.19 |

### Cost Factors
- Image dimensions significantly impact cost
- Higher quality settings require more tokens
- Complexity of prompt affects token usage
- Larger images increase both cost and latency

## API Usage

### Basic Request Example
```python
import openai

response = openai.Image.create(
    model="gpt-image-1",
    prompt="A serene landscape with mountains and a lake at sunset",
    size="1024x1024",
    quality="standard",
    n=1
)

image_url = response.data[0].url
```

### Advanced Parameters
```python
response = openai.Image.create(
    model="gpt-image-1",
    prompt="Professional logo for a tech startup, minimalist design",
    size="1024x1024",
    quality="high",
    style="vivid",  # or "natural"
    n=1,
    response_format="url"  # or "b64_json"
)
```

### Quality Settings
- **Low**: Fastest generation, lowest cost
- **Standard/Medium**: Balanced quality and speed
- **High**: Maximum quality, higher computational cost
