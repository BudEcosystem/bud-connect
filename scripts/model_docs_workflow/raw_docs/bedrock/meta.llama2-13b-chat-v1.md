- Regional availability limitations may affect deployment options

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
- Use clear, specific prompts for better results
- Follow recommended prompt templates for optimal performance
- Consider context window limitations when designing conversations
- Test prompts thoroughly before production deployment

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust `max_gen_len` based on expected response length
- Use appropriate `temperature` settings for desired creativity level
- Monitor token usage to optimize costs
- Consider provisioned throughput for high-volume applications

### Security and Compliance
- Implement proper IAM policies for access control
- Monitor API usage through CloudWatch
- Follow AWS security best practices
- Review generated content for compliance requirements
