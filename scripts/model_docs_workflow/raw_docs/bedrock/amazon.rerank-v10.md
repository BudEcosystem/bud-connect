# Amazon Rerank 1.0 - AWS Bedrock Documentation

## Model Overview and Description

Amazon Rerank 1.0 is a reranking model available through AWS Bedrock's Rerank API, designed to improve the relevance of query responses in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. The model calculates the relevance of document chunks to a query and reorders the results based on calculated relevance scores, helping retrieve fewer but more relevant results.

**Note**: While the request mentions "amazon.rerank-v10", the official AWS documentation consistently refers to this model as "Amazon Rerank 1.0" or "Amazon-rerank-v1.0".

## Technical Specifications

### Model Details
- **Model ID**: `amazon.rerank-v1.0`
- **Model Type**: Reranking/Document Scoring
- **Data Support**: Text-only (textual data exclusively)
- **Maximum Documents**: Up to 100 document chunks per query
- **Input Requirements**:
  - A user query (text)
  - List of documents to reorder
  - Sources for reranking

### API Configuration
- **Request Format**: JSON with query and document sources
- **Response Format**: 
  - `relevanceScore`: Relevance score assigned by the reranking model
  - `index`: Document ranking relative to other documents (lower score = higher ranking)
- **Document Types**: Both text and JSON document formats supported

## AWS Bedrock Specific Capabilities and Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Query Response Improvement**: Enhances relevance of retrieved results in RAG applications
- **Document Reordering**: Automatically reorders documents based on calculated relevance scores
- **Relevance Scoring**: Provides numerical relevance scores for each document
- **Integration Ready**: Seamlessly integrates with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases

### Usage Methods
1. **Direct API Access**: Use Rerank operation with Agents for Amazon Bedrock runtime endpoint
2. **Knowledge Bases Integration**: 
   - Available in `Retrieve` operations
   - Available in `RetrieveAndGenerate` operations
   - Can be used when querying knowledge bases in AWS Management Console

### Enterprise Features
- **Scalable Processing**: Handles up to 100 document chunks per query
- **Multi-query Support**: Additional queries counted separately if exceeding 100 chunks
- **Console Integration**: Available through AWS Management Console for knowledge base queries

## Pricing Information (AWS Bedrock Pricing Structure)

### On-Demand Pricing
- **Cost per Query**: $0.001 per request
- **Alternative Pricing**: $1.00 per 1,000 queries
- **Query Definition**: Each query can contain up to 100 document chunks
- **Overage Handling**: Queries with >100 chunks counted as multiple queries proportionally

### Billing Structure
- Charged based on number of queries processed
- Monthly billing cycle
- Pay-per-use model with no upfront costs

## API Usage Details (AWS Bedrock API)

### API Endpoint
- **Service**: Amazon Bedrock Agent Runtime
- **Operation**: `Rerank`
- **Access Method**: REST API through AWS SDK

### Request Structure
```json
{
  "query": "user query text",
  "sources": [
    {
      "type": "TEXT",
      "data": "document content"
    }
  ],
  "maxResults": number // optional
}
```

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "relevanceScore": float,
      "index": integer,
      "document": object
    }
  ]
}
```

### SDK Integration
- Available through boto3 (Python)
- AWS CLI support
- Multiple language SDK support

## Performance Benchmarks

### Accuracy Improvements
- Designed to generate "more pertinent and accurate responses"
- Optimized for RAG application performance
- Reduces irrelevant results in document retrieval

### Processing Efficiency
- Handles up to 100 documents per query efficiently
- Optimized for real-time applications
- Low-latency response times for typical use cases

## Use Cases and Applications

### Primary Use Cases
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Improve relevance of retrieved documents
- **Document Search**: Enhance search result relevance
- **Question Answering**: Better document selection for Q&A systems
- **Knowledge Base Queries**: Optimize knowledge base response accuracy

### Industry Applications
- **Enterprise Search**: Internal document and knowledge systems
- **Customer Support**: Relevant information retrieval for support queries
- **Research Applications**: Academic and technical document ranking
- **Content Management**: Improve content discovery and relevance

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Text-Only Support**: Limited to textual data processing (no multimodal support)
- **Document Limit**: Maximum 100 document chunks per query
- **Language**: Primarily optimized for English text
- **Real-time Only**: No batch processing capabilities mentioned

### Performance Considerations
- Query complexity may impact response times
- Document length and complexity affect processing
- Network latency considerations for API calls

### Cost Considerations
- Additional cost layer for RAG applications
- Per-query pricing model requires usage monitoring
- Multiple queries for large document sets increase costs
