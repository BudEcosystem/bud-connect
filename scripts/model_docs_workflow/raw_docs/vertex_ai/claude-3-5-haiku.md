- Startup credits do not cover Claude models (not Google-owned services)
- Prices listed in USD, local currency rates apply based on Cloud Platform SKUs

## API Usage and Implementation

### Vertex AI API Endpoint Structure
Unlike the direct Anthropic API, Vertex AI uses a different endpoint structure:
- Model is specified in the Google Cloud endpoint URL (not request body)
- `anthropic_version` is passed in request body (not header)
- Required version value: `vertex-2023-10-16`

### Python SDK Example
```python
from anthropic import AnthropicVertex

# Initialize client
client = AnthropicVertex(
    project_id="your-project-id",
    region="us-east5"
)

# Send request
message = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-haiku@20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Your prompt here"
        }
    ]
)
print(message.content)
```

### Streaming Implementation
```python
# Streaming response for reduced latency
stream = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-haiku@20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt"}],
    stream=True
)

for event in stream:
    print(event.content)
```
