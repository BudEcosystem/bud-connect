## Vertex AI Integration Details

### API Endpoint Structure
```
POST https://{REGION}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{REGION}/publishers/anthropic/models/claude-3-haiku@20240307:streamRawPredict
```

### Key API Differences from Direct Anthropic API
1. **Model Specification**: Model ID specified in URL endpoint, not request body
2. **API Version**: Uses `anthropic_version: "vertex-2023-10-16"` in request body
3. **Authentication**: Google Cloud IAM instead of Anthropic API keys
4. **Billing**: Integrated with Google Cloud billing system

### Request Format
```json
{
  "anthropic_version": "vertex-2023-10-16",
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user", 
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Your prompt here"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "max_tokens": 8000
}
```

## Version-Specific Considerations

### Why Use Versioned Models
- **Consistency**: Guaranteed reproducible behavior across deployments
- **Stability**: Protection against model updates that might affect performance
- **Compliance**: Required for production environments needing stable model behavior
- **Testing**: Ensures consistent results during development and testing phases

### Model Versioning Best Practices
- Always use versioned models (with @ suffix) in production
- Avoid non-versioned model names (claude-3-haiku) for consistency
- Plan for model version updates and testing cycles
- Monitor for new version releases and migration paths

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Output Token Limit**: Maximum 8,000 tokens per response
- **Image Size Restrictions**: 5 MB maximum per image file
- **Batch Processing**: No batch prediction capabilities
- **Extended Reasoning**: Not optimized for complex reasoning tasks

### Recommended Usage Patterns
- High-volume, low-complexity tasks
- Speed-critical applications
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Real-time interactive systems

## Monitoring and Observability

### Request-Response Logging
- **Duration**: 30-day retention period
- **Content**: Full prompt and completion logging
- **Purpose**: Compliance monitoring and usage analysis
- **Privacy**: Customer controlled, not shared with Anthropic

### Performance Metrics
- **Token Usage**: Input and output token consumption
- **Response Times**: Latency measurements
- **Error Rates**: API error tracking and analysis
- **Quota Usage**: Regional quota consumption monitoring

## Migration and Compatibility

### Upgrading from Non-Versioned Models
- Test thoroughly with versioned model before switching
- Validate output consistency and performance
- Update API calls to use versioned endpoint
- Monitor for any behavioral differences

### Integration with Existing Systems
- Compatible with existing Anthropic SDK integrations
