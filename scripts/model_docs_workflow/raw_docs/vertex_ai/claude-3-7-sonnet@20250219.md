## Best Practices for Extended Thinking

### Thinking Budget Optimization
- **Simple Tasks**: Use standard mode or minimal thinking budget (1024 tokens)
- **Medium Complexity**: Allocate 2000-3000 thinking tokens
- **Complex Analysis**: Use 3000-5000+ thinking tokens
- **Research Tasks**: Allocate larger budgets for comprehensive analysis
- **Cost Monitoring**: Track thinking token usage for cost optimization

### Prompt Engineering for Extended Thinking
```python
# Effective prompt patterns for extended thinking
complex_analysis_prompt = """
Please analyze [complex topic] using extended thinking. In your analysis:

1. First, break down the problem into its key components
2. Consider multiple perspectives and approaches
3. Evaluate evidence and potential counterarguments
4. Identify assumptions and limitations
5. Synthesize findings into a coherent conclusion

Use your extended thinking to show your reasoning process step by step.
"""

research_prompt = """
Research question: [specific question]

Please use extended thinking to:
- Systematically explore this question
- Consider relevant methodologies and approaches
- Evaluate available evidence
- Address potential limitations and biases
- Provide a well-reasoned analysis with supporting citations
"""
```

### Performance and Cost Management
- **Mode Selection**: Choose appropriate thinking mode based on task complexity
- **Budget Allocation**: Balance thinking depth with cost considerations
- **Usage Monitoring**: Track thinking token consumption patterns
- **Optimization**: Regular review of thinking budget effectiveness
- **Scaling**: Plan thinking budget allocation for production workloads
