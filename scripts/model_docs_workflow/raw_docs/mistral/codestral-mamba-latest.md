# Codestral Mamba Latest

## Model Overview

Codestral Mamba is a Mamba2 language model specialized in code generation, available under an Apache 2.0 license. It's a 7-billion parameter code generation model by Mistral AI, utilizing the Mamba architecture for efficient and extended context coding. The model was developed in collaboration with Albert Gu and Tri Dao.

## API Usage Details

### API Endpoints
- **IDE integrations**: `codestral.mistral.ai`
- **General use**: `api.mistral.ai`

### Python Example
```python
import os
from mistralai import Mistral

api_key = os.environ["MISTRAL_API_KEY"]
client = Mistral(api_key=api_key)

model = "codestral-mamba-latest"
messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a function for fibonacci"}]

chat_response = client.chat.complete(
    model=model,
    messages=messages
)

print(chat_response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Installation
```bash
pip install mistral_inference>=1 mamba-ssm causal-conv1d
```

## Deployment Options

### Cloud Deployment
- Mistral La Plateforme (official API)
- Coming soon: llama.cpp support

### Self-Hosting
- mistral-inference SDK
- TensorRT-LLM
- Download weights from HuggingFace for custom deployment

### Hardware Requirements
- **Minimum**: NVIDIA RTX A6000
- **Recommended for inference**: NVIDIA L40, NVIDIA A100
- **Recommended for fine-tuning**: NVIDIA H100 PCIe, NVIDIA H100 SXM

## Use Cases and Applications

### Primary Use Cases
- Code completion and generation
- Code review and analysis
- Documentation generation
- Bug detection and fixing
- Code translation between languages
- Test case generation
- API implementation from specifications

### Integration Scenarios
- IDE plugins and extensions
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Automated code review systems
- Educational coding assistants
- Pair programming tools

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- While supporting 256k token context, performance may vary with extremely long inputs
- Specialized for code; may not perform as well on general text tasks
- Requires significant GPU memory for self-hosting

### Licensing Considerations
- Apache 2.0 license allows commercial use
- No attribution required but appreciated
- Patent protection included
- Note: This differs from Codestral 22B which has more restrictive licensing

## Code Examples and Implementation Guides

### Basic Code Generation
```python
# Generate a sorting algorithm
prompt = "Implement a merge sort algorithm in Python with comments"
response = client.chat.complete(
    model="codestral-mamba-latest",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)
```

### Multi-turn Conversation
```python
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Create a Python class for a binary tree"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here's a binary tree class..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Now add a method to find the height"}
]

response = client.chat.complete(
    model="codestral-mamba-latest",
    messages=messages
)
```

### Long Context Usage
```python
# For files up to 256k tokens
with open('large_codebase.py', 'r') as f:
    code_content = f.read()

prompt = f"Analyze this code and suggest improvements:\n\n{code_content}"
response = client.chat.complete(
    model="codestral-mamba-latest",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)
```
