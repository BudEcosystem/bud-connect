## Architecture

- **Model Type:** Transformer-based language model
- **Architecture Features:**
  - Sliding Window Attention (SWA) mechanism
  - Each layer attends to the previous 4,096 hidden states
  - Optimized for both performance and efficiency
- **Fast deployment** and easily customizable design

## Technical Specifications

- **Parameters:** 7 billion
- **Context Window:** 8K tokens
- **Attention Window:** 4,096 tokens (sliding window)
- **License:** Apache 2.0 (fully open source)
- **Model IDs:** 
  - Current: `open-mistral-7b`
  - Legacy: `mistral-tiny-2312`, `mistral-tiny` (deprecated)

## Pricing Information

- **Open Source:** Free to use under Apache 2.0 license
- **Self-hosted:** No licensing costs, only infrastructure
- **API Access:** Available through La Plateforme
