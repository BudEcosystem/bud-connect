## API Usage with Image Inputs

### Basic Implementation
```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Configure client for xAI
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
    api_key="your-xai-api-key"
)

# Simple image analysis
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-vision-beta",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "What do you see in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    max_tokens=1000
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Working with Base64 Images
```python
import base64

# Load and encode image
with open("local_image.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    base64_image = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-vision-beta",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```
