    api_key="your-xai-api-key"
)

# Image input example
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2-vision",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {
                        "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
                    }
