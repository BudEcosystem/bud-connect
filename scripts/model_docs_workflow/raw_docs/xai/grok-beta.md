## API Usage Details

### Beta API Access
```
Base URL: https://api.x.ai/v1
Model Name: grok-beta
Note: Same endpoint as stable versions
```

### Basic Implementation

#### Python Example
```python
from openai import OpenAI
import json

# Initialize with beta model
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your-xai-api-key",
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1"
)

# Standard usage
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-beta",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Test the latest beta features"}
    ],
    temperature=0.7
)

# Beta-specific features (example)
try:
    # Experimental parameters may be available
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="grok-beta",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Use experimental reasoning"}],
        # Hypothetical beta parameter
        experimental_features=["enhanced_reasoning", "extended_context"]
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Beta feature error: {e}")
```

#### Error Handling for Beta
```python
def safe_beta_call(client, messages, **kwargs):
    """
    Wrapper for beta API calls with fallback
    """
    try:
        return client.chat.completions.create(
            model="grok-beta",
            messages=messages,
            **kwargs
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Beta error: {e}")
        # Fallback to stable version
        return client.chat.completions.create(
            model="grok-2-latest",
            messages=messages
        )
```

### Testing Beta Features

#### Feature Detection
```python
def check_beta_features():
    """
    Test available beta features
    """
    test_prompts = {
        "reasoning": "Solve this step by step: If all A are B, and all B are C, what can we say about A and C?",
        "multimodal": "Describe this image in detail [attach image]",
        "tools": "What tools are available to you?",
        "context": "Can you remember this: [long context test]"
    }
    
    results = {}
    for feature, prompt in test_prompts.items():
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="grok-beta",
                messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
            )
            results[feature] = "supported"
        except Exception as e:
            results[feature] = f"error: {str(e)}"
    
    return results
```

#### Streaming with Beta
```python
# Beta streaming might have experimental features
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-beta",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Stream this response"}],
    stream=True,
    # Potential beta streaming options
    stream_options={"include_usage": True}  # If available in beta
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
    # Check for beta-specific stream data
    if hasattr(chunk, 'beta_metadata'):
        print(f"\nBeta info: {chunk.beta_metadata}")
```

## Performance Benchmarks

## Limitations and Considerations

### Beta-Specific Limitations
1. **Stability Issues**
   - Features may break or change
   - Unexpected behaviors possible
   - Performance variations
   - API changes without notice

2. **Documentation Gaps**
   - Experimental features may lack docs
   - Parameters might be undocumented
   - Behavior may differ from description

3. **Support Limitations**
   - Limited support for beta features
   - Community-driven troubleshooting
   - No SLA guarantees

### Technical Considerations
1. **Version Management**
   ```python
   # Track beta version behavior
   import hashlib
   
   def get_beta_signature(response):
       """Generate signature for beta behavior tracking"""
       content = response.choices[0].message.content
       return hashlib.md5(content.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
   ```

2. **Fallback Strategy**
   ```python
   # Implement fallback for production use
   def get_model_with_fallback():
       try:
           # Try beta first
           test_response = client.chat.completions.create(
               model="grok-beta",
               messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "test"}],
               max_tokens=10
           )
           return "grok-beta"
       except:
           return "grok-2-latest"
   ```

3. **Change Detection**
   ```python
   # Monitor for behavior changes
   def detect_beta_changes(baseline_responses):
       current_responses = run_test_suite()
       changes = []
       for test, current in current_responses.items():
           if test in baseline_responses:
               if current != baseline_responses[test]:
                   changes.append(test)
       return changes
   ```

### Best Practices for Beta

1. **Isolate Beta Usage**
   - Separate beta testing from production
   - Use feature flags for beta features
   - Maintain stable fallbacks

2. **Monitor Actively**
   - Log all beta interactions
   - Track performance metrics
   - Document observed behaviors

3. **Contribute Feedback**
   - Report bugs and issues
   - Suggest improvements
   - Share use case results

## Migration and Compatibility

### Beta to Stable Migration
1. **Feature Graduation**
   - Beta features may move to stable
   - API changes might be required
   - Behavior may be refined

2. **Code Preparation**
   ```python
   # Prepare for feature graduation
   def use_feature(feature_name, fallback=True):
       try:
           # Try beta feature
           return use_beta_feature(feature_name)
       except FeatureNotAvailable:
           if fallback:
               return use_stable_alternative(feature_name)
           raise
   ```

3. **Version Tracking**
   - Document which beta features you use
   - Track feature announcements
   - Plan migration timeline

### Compatibility Notes
- API structure matches stable versions
- Core functionality remains consistent
- Beta-specific parameters may not be portable
- Consider abstraction layers for easy migration
