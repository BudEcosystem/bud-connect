# Initialize client with xAI endpoint
client = OpenAI(
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
    api_key="your-xai-api-key"
)

# Single image analysis
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2-vision-latest",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Analyze this chart and provide insights"},
                {
                    "type": "image_url",
                    "image_url": {"url": "data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_image}"}
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    temperature=0.7
)

# Multiple image comparison
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2-vision-latest",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": [
                {"type": "text", "text": "Compare these two diagrams"},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "url_to_image1.jpg"}},
                {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "url_to_image2.jpg"}}
            ]
        }
    ]
)
```
