# Claude 3.7 Sonnet (claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219)

## Model Overview

Claude 3.7 Sonnet is Anthropic's most intelligent model to date (as of February 2025) and the first hybrid reasoning model generally available on the market. Announced on February 19, 2025, it represents a significant leap forward in AI capabilities, particularly in coding and reasoning tasks.

## Key Improvements Over Previous Versions

### Hybrid Reasoning Capability
- **Dual Mode Operation**: Functions as both an ordinary LLM and a reasoning model
- **Extended Thinking Mode**: Self-reflects before answering, improving performance on math, physics, instruction-following, and coding tasks
- **Flexible Thinking Budget**: API users can control thinking budget up to 128K tokens
- **Visible Thinking Process**: Makes its thought process visible in raw form

### Performance Enhancements
- **State-of-the-art on SWE-bench Verified**: Exceptional ability to solve real-world software issues
- **Coding Excellence**: Particularly strong improvements in coding and front-end web development
- **Better Instruction Following**: Enhanced ability to follow complex instructions accurately

## Technical Specifications

### Context and Output
- **Context Window**: Standard context window (inherited from previous Sonnet models)
- **Maximum Output**: 128K tokens (with beta header `output-128k-2025-02-19`)
- **Knowledge Cutoff**: October 2024 (trained on data through November 2024)

### Model Capabilities
- Hybrid reasoning model with toggle-able extended thinking mode
- Advanced code generation and debugging
- Complex problem-solving across multiple domains
- Tool use and function calling support

## Pricing Information

- **Input Tokens**: $3 per million tokens
- **Output Tokens**: $15 per million tokens
- **Note**: Pricing includes thinking tokens in extended thinking mode

## API Usage Details

### Model ID

### API Configuration
```python
# Example API usage
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Standard mode
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt here"}],
    max_tokens=4096
)

# Extended output (128k tokens)
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Your prompt here"}],
    max_tokens=128000,
    extra_headers={"anthropic-beta": "output-128k-2025-02-19"}
)
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Coding Performance
- **SWE-bench Verified**: State-of-the-art performance

- Limited research preview for developers

## Limitations and Considerations

### Known Limitations
- Knowledge cutoff date of October 2024
- Thinking tokens count toward output limits
- Extended thinking mode may increase latency

### Best Practices
- Use specific model version (`claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`) for production
- Consider thinking budget for cost optimization
- Toggle extended thinking mode based on task complexity

## Migration Guide

### From Previous Sonnet Models
1. **API Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for previous Sonnet models
2. **Pricing**: Same pricing structure as predecessors
3. **New Features**: 
   - Enable extended thinking mode when needed
   - Use beta header for 128k output support
   - Control thinking budget for optimization

### Key Considerations
- Test extended thinking mode for your use cases
- Monitor token usage including thinking tokens
- Leverage improved coding capabilities for development tasks
