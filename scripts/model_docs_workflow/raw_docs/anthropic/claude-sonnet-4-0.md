# No other code changes required
```

### From Other Models

#### Comparison Guide
```python
def select_claude_model(requirements):
    if requirements["complexity"] == "extreme":
        return "claude-opus-4-20250514"
    elif requirements["coding_focus"] and requirements["cost_sensitive"]:

### Tool Use Examples
```python
# Define tools
tools = [
    {
        "name": "search_web",
        "description": "Search for current information",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "query": {"type": "string"}
            }
        }
    }
]

# Use with extended thinking
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Research and summarize..."}],
    tools=tools,
    thinking_mode="extended"
)
```

### Parallel Tool Execution

# Multiple tools can be called simultaneously
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Analyze multiple data sources"}],
    tools=[web_search_tool, database_query_tool, file_reader_tool],
    tool_choice="auto"
)
```

## Best Practices

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Use Streaming**: For real-time applications
2. **Implement Caching**: For repeated queries
3. **Batch Requests**: For bulk processing
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track token consumption

### Code Example
```python
# Optimized implementation
async def process_with_sonnet_4(task):
    # Use streaming for responsiveness
    stream = await client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": task}],
        stream=True,
        max_tokens=8192
    )
    
    async for chunk in stream:
        yield chunk.content
```
