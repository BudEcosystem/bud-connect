### Best Practices
```python
# Development pattern
if environment == "development":
    model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"
else:
    model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"  # Specific version for production
```

## Migration Guide

### Switching from Latest to Versioned
1. **Identify Current Version**: Check which version the alias currently points to
2. **Update Code**: Replace alias with specific version string
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure behavior remains consistent
4. **Document Version**: Record the version in your deployment notes

### Example Migration
```python
# Before (development)
model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"

# After (production)
model = "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"  # Lock to specific version
```

### Version Tracking
```python
# Track version for debugging
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Client()
models = client.models.list()

# Find current version for latest alias
for model in models:
    if model.id == "claude-3-7-sonnet-latest":
        print(f"Latest points to: {model.created_at}")
```

## Monitoring and Updates

### Staying Informed
- Monitor Anthropic's announcements for new releases
- Test applications when updates are announced
- Subscribe to Anthropic's developer newsletter

### Update Strategy
1. **Development First**: Let alias update in development
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Verify no breaking changes
3. **Update Production**: Manually update to new version after testing
