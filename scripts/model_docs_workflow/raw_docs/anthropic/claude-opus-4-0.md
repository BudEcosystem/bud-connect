client = anthropic.Client(api_key="your-api-key")

# Standard usage
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Complex coding task"}],
    max_tokens=32000
)

# With extended thinking
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Solve this complex problem"}],
    max_tokens=32000,
    thinking_budget=50000  # Control thinking depth
)
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Coding Excellence
- **SWE-bench**: 72.5% (World's best)
- **Terminal-bench**: 43.2% (Leading performance)
- **TAU-bench**: State-of-the-art on complex agent applications
- **Long-horizon Tasks**: Exceptional accuracy

### Real-World Validation
- **Rakuten**: 7-hour independent refactor with sustained performance
- **Cursor**: "State-of-the-art for coding and complex codebase understanding"
- **Cognition**: "Excels at solving complex challenges other models can't"

## Use Cases and Applications

### Primary Applications

1. **Advanced Software Development**
   - Days-long engineering tasks
   - Complex refactoring projects
   - Multi-file codebase modifications
   - Architectural improvements

2. **Autonomous Agents**
   - Long-running agent workflows
   - Complex multi-step processes
   - Independent task execution
   - Background processing

3. **Research and Analysis**
   - Deep technical research
   - Complex problem solving
   - Multi-domain integration
   - Extended analysis tasks

### Claude Code Integration
- Enables background execution
- Assign long-running coding tasks
- Work continues independently
- Developers can check progress asynchronously

## Limitations and Considerations

### Operational Considerations
- Higher cost compared to other models
- Best suited for complex, high-value tasks
- Extended thinking increases latency
- Requires careful task scoping for cost efficiency

### Best Practices
1. **Task Selection**: Reserve for genuinely complex tasks
2. **Cost Management**: Use prompt caching for repeated contexts
3. **Batch Processing**: Leverage 50% discount for non-urgent tasks
4. **Thinking Budget**: Set appropriate limits for task complexity

## Migration Guide

### From Claude 3 Opus
1. **API Compatibility**: Similar API structure with new features
2. **Performance Gains**: Dramatic improvements in coding and reasoning
3. **New Capabilities**: 
   - Extended thinking mode
   - Tool use during reasoning
   - Longer task duration support

### Implementation Strategy
```python
# Gradual migration approach
def select_model(task_complexity):
    if task_complexity == "extreme":
        return "claude-opus-4-20250514"
    elif task_complexity == "high":
        return "claude-3-opus-20240229"
    else:
        return "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"
```

### Key Migration Considerations
- Test extended thinking for your use cases
- Implement cost monitoring
- Leverage new tool capabilities
- Plan for longer execution times

## Advanced Features

### Tool Use During Thinking
```python
# Example with web search during reasoning
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Research and implement..."}],
    tools=[web_search_tool],
    thinking_mode="extended"
)
```

### Background Execution Pattern
```python
# Claude Code background task
task = client.background_tasks.create(
    model="claude-opus-4-20250514",
    task="Refactor entire authentication system",
    duration_hours=4,
    checkpoints=True
)
```
