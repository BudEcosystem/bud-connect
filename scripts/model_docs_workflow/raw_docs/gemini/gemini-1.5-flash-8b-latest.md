]

responses = []
for task in tasks:
    response = model.generate_content(task)
    responses.append(response.text)
```

### Simple Multimodal Tasks
```python
import PIL.Image

# Basic image analysis
image = PIL.Image.open('simple_chart.png')
response = model.generate_content([
    "What type of chart is this? Give a one-sentence answer.",
    image
])
```

### Text Classification
```python
# Simple classification tasks
def classify_email(email_text):
    prompt = f"""
    Classify this email as 'spam' or 'not spam'. 
    Just answer with one word.
    
    Email: {email_text}
    """
    response = model.generate_content(prompt)
    return response.text.strip()

# Example usage
emails = [
    "Win money now! Click here!",
    "Meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2pm",
    "URGENT: Claim your prize immediately!"
]

for email in emails:
    classification = classify_email(email)
    print(f"Email: {email[:30]}... -> {classification}")
```

# Implement validation for critical tasks
def validate_classification(text, classification):
    confidence_check = model.generate_content(
        f"On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that '{text}' "
        f"is classified as '{classification}'? Just give a number."
    )
    return int(confidence_check.text.strip()) > 7
```
