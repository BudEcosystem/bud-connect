- Cost-sensitive deployments

## Migration Considerations

### From Production Models
- **Experimental Nature**: Expect changes and instability
- **Feature Differences**: May have unique capabilities
- **API Changes**: Interface may differ from stable versions
- **Performance Variability**: Results may be inconsistent

### Testing Strategy
1. Parallel testing with production models
2. Limited rollout for specific use cases
3. Comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Fallback to stable models
5. Regular performance evaluation

## Limitations and Warnings

### Experimental Status
- **No SLA**: No service level agreements
- **Breaking Changes**: APIs may change without notice
- **Availability**: May be discontinued or modified
- **Support**: Limited support resources
- **Documentation**: May be incomplete or changing

### Known Limitations
- Rate limits more restrictive
- Possible downtime for updates
- Feature instability
- Performance variations
- Limited regional availability

## Development Guidelines

### Best Practices
1. **Isolation**: Keep experimental code separate
2. **Monitoring**: Track all interactions and results
3. **Fallbacks**: Implement robust error handling
4. **Documentation**: Document observed behaviors
5. **Feedback**: Report issues to Google team

### Testing Approach
```python
# Example safe testing pattern
try:
    response = experimental_model.generate(prompt)
except ExperimentalModelError:
    response = fallback_model.generate(prompt)
```

## Future Path

### Expected Evolution
1. Graduation to production status
2. Feature stabilization
3. Performance optimization
4. Broader availability
5. Production-ready pricing

### Timeline Considerations
- Experimental phase duration unknown
- Features may migrate to other models
- Some capabilities may be discontinued
- Production release depends on testing results
