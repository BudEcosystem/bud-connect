# Google Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B-Exp-0924 Model Documentation

## Model Overview and Description

Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B-Exp-0924 appears to be an experimental version of Google's 8-billion-parameter Flash model, likely released on September 24, 2024. Based on Google's experimental model naming convention, this would represent an iteration on the Flash-8B model family between the initial August 27 experimental release and the October 2024 general availability.

**Note**: Limited public documentation is available for this specific experimental version. Information is inferred from Google's model naming patterns and the experimental model program.
