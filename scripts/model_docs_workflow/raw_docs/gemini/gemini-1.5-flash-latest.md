model_latest = 'gemini-1.5-flash-latest'

# Or specify exact version
model_v1 = 'gemini-1.5-flash-001'
model_v2 = 'gemini-1.5-flash-002'
```

### Basic Implementation (Python)
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure API
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Initialize with latest version
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')

# Generate content
response = model.generate_content("Explain quantum computing in simple terms")
print(response.text)
```

### Multimodal Example
```python
import PIL.Image

# Process image with text
image = PIL.Image.open('diagram.png')
response = model.generate_content([
    "Analyze this diagram and explain what it shows:",
    image
])
```

### Audio Processing
```python
# Process audio file
with open('conversation.mp3', 'rb') as audio_file:
    audio_data = audio_file.read()

response = model.generate_content([
    "Transcribe this audio and summarize the key points:",
    audio_data
])
```

### PDF Processing
```python
# Analyze PDF document
with open('report.pdf', 'rb') as pdf_file:
    pdf_data = pdf_file.read()

response = model.generate_content([
    "Extract and summarize the main findings from this PDF:",
    pdf_data
])
```

### Streaming Responses
```python
# Stream responses for better UX
response = model.generate_content(
    "Write a detailed analysis of climate change",
    stream=True
)

for chunk in response:
    print(chunk.text, end='')
```
