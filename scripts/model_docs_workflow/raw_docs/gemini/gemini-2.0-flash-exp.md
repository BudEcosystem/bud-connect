## API Usage

### Model Naming Convention
- Latest stable version: `gemini-2.0-flash`
- Specific version: `gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- Experimental version: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`

### Using Google Gen AI SDK (Python)
```python
from google import genai

client = genai.Client(
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY"
)

response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-exp',
    contents='How does AI work?'
)

print(response.text)
```

### Using OpenAI-Compatible API (Python)
```python
from google.auth import default
import google.auth.transport.requests
import openai

# Configure authentication
credentials, _ = default(scopes=["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform"])
credentials.refresh(google.auth.transport.requests.Request())

# Initialize client
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url=f"https://{location}-aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location}/endpoints/openapi",
    api_key=credentials.token,
)

# Make request
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="google/gemini-2.0-flash-001",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Why is the sky blue?"}],
)
```

### Multimodal Generation Example
```python
# Generate text with inline images
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-2.0-flash-exp',
    contents='Create a blog post about sustainable living with relevant images'
)
```
