model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro-002')

# Generate content
response = model.generate_content("Explain machine learning in simple terms")
print(response.text)
```

### Multilingual Example
```python
# Demonstrate improved multilingual capabilities
languages = ['Korean', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish', 'Japanese', 'Russian', 'Chinese']

for lang in languages:
    response = model.generate_content(
        f"Translate 'Welcome to the future of AI' to {lang} and explain any cultural nuances"
    )
    print(f"{lang}: {response.text}\n")
```

### Long Context Processing
```python
# Process large documents with improved quality
with open('technical_manual.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    manual_content = file.read()

response = model.generate_content([
    "Analyze this technical manual and create a comprehensive summary with:",
    "1. Main topics covered",
    "2. Key technical specifications",
    "3. Important warnings or notes",
    "4. Suggested improvements",
    manual_content
])
```

### Multimodal Analysis
```python
import PIL.Image

# Enhanced multimodal understanding
image = PIL.Image.open('complex_diagram.jpg')
audio_file = open('explanation.mp3', 'rb').read()

response = model.generate_content([
    "Compare the visual diagram with the audio explanation and identify any discrepancies:",
    image,
    audio_file
])
