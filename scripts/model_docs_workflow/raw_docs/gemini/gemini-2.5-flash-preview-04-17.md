model_name = "gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17"

# After GA (expected)
model_name = "gemini-2.5-flash"
```

### Thinking Configuration
```python
# Example with thinking budget
response = model.generate(
    prompt="Complex problem...",
    thinking_budget=1000  # Number of thinking tokens
)

# Dynamic thinking
response = model.generate(
    prompt="Analyze this...",
    thinking_budget=-1  # Model decides budget
)
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Key Metrics
- **Price-Performance**: Best in Gemini family
- **Speed**: Maintains Flash-level latency
- **Quality**: Significant improvement over 2.0 Flash
- **Reasoning**: Comparable to Pro models
- **Efficiency**: Optimized token usage

### Benchmark Areas
1. Complex reasoning tasks
2. Code generation and analysis
3. Mathematical problems
4. Multi-step planning
5. Cost efficiency metrics

## Use Cases and Features

### Primary Applications
1. **Intelligent Assistants**: Reasoning at scale
2. **Code Analysis**: Understanding complex codebases
3. **Problem Solving**: Multi-step solutions
4. **Data Analysis**: Intelligent insights
5. **Educational Tools**: Explanatory capabilities

### Thinking-Enabled Features
- **Step-by-Step Solutions**: Break down complex problems
- **Reasoning Chains**: Logical progression tracking
- **Decision Trees**: Explore multiple paths
- **Error Analysis**: Understand and fix issues

## Migration from Older Versions

### From Gemini 2.0 Flash
- **Direct Upgrade**: API-compatible
- **New Feature**: Add thinking capabilities
- **Performance**: Better quality, same speed
- **Cost**: Similar pricing structure

### From Non-Thinking Models
```python
# Before (2.0 Flash)
response = model.generate(prompt)

# After (2.5 Flash with thinking)
response = model.generate(
    prompt,
    thinking_budget=500  # New parameter
)
thinking_steps = response.thinking  # New output
```

## Thinking Implementation

### Thinking Budget
- **Dynamic Mode**: thinking_budget = -1
- **Fixed Budget**: Specify token count
- **Optimization**: Model manages efficiency
- **Scaling**: Budget affects response quality

### Best Practices
1. Use dynamic thinking for variable complexity
2. Set fixed budgets for consistent costs
3. Start with lower budgets and adjust
4. Monitor thinking token usage
5. Compare with non-thinking for simple tasks
