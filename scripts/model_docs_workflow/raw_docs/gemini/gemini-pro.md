# Google Gemini Pro Documentation

## Model Overview

Google Gemini Pro is part of Google's first-generation Gemini family of multimodal AI models, originally released on December 13, 2023. Positioned as the "best model for scaling across a wide range of tasks," Gemini Pro sits between Gemini Ultra (the largest and most capable model) and Gemini Nano (the most efficient model for on-device tasks).

The model was announced on December 6, 2023, as Google's direct competitor to OpenAI's GPT-4. Starting December 13, developers and enterprise customers gained access to Gemini Pro via the Gemini API in Google AI Studio or Google Cloud Vertex AI.

**Current Status**: All Gemini 1.0 models, including Gemini Pro, have been retired (all requests return a 404 error). Google has moved to newer versions like Gemini 1.5 and 2.0 series.

## Technical Specifications

- Code execution abilities
- Context caching for cost reduction
- Better performance across all benchmarks

## Summary

Google Gemini Pro represented a significant milestone in Google's AI development, offering a balanced multimodal model that competed directly with GPT-3.5 at launch. While now retired, it established Google's presence in the large language model space and paved the way for more advanced versions. Its key innovations included native multimodal design, competitive pricing, and strong integration with Google's ecosystem. However, limitations in developer experience, safety constraints, and ecosystem maturity presented challenges. Users seeking similar capabilities should now use Gemini 1.5 Pro or newer versions, which offer substantial improvements in context length, reasoning abilities, and overall performance.
