# Gemini 1.5 Pro

## Model Overview

Gemini 1.5 Pro is a mid-size multimodal model optimized for a wide range of reasoning tasks, designed for high-volume, cost-effective applications without compromising quality. It features the same industry-leading 2 million token context window as the latest version and can process extensive amounts of data across multiple modalities.

## API Usage

### Model Naming Convention
```
# General format
<model>-<generation>-<variation>-<version>

# Examples
gemini-1.5-pro        # Latest available version
gemini-1.5-pro-001    # Specific version 001
gemini-1.5-pro-002    # Specific version 002
```

### Basic Implementation (Python)
```python
import google.generativeai as genai

# Configure API
genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Use latest version
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro')

# Or specify version
model_v1 = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro-001')
model_v2 = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro-002')

# Generate content
response = model.generate_content("Explain the theory of relativity")
print(response.text)
```

### Multimodal Example
```python
import PIL.Image

model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-pro-002')

# Process image with text
image = PIL.Image.open('diagram.jpg')
response = model.generate_content([
    "Analyze this technical diagram and explain the process it depicts:",
    image
])
```

### Long Context Processing
```python
# Process large document
with open('research_paper.pdf', 'rb') as file:
    pdf_content = file.read()

response = model.generate_content([
    "Summarize the key findings and methodology of this research paper:",
    pdf_content
])
```

## Pricing Information

### Pricing Structure
- Same pricing across both 001 and 002 versions
- Free tier available through Google AI Studio
- Paid tier with higher rate limits
- Batch mode offers 50% discount for asynchronous processing

### Cost Optimization
- Use batch mode for large-scale processing
- Implement context caching for repeated content
- Monitor token usage to optimize costs

## Performance Characteristics

### Version 002 Improvements
- Enhanced multilingual capabilities
- Better understanding across 102 languages
- Improved response quality
- More accurate translations and cultural understanding

### General Performance
- Optimized for speed and efficiency
- Suitable for high-volume applications
- Maintains quality while being cost-effective
- Lower latency compared to larger models

## Use Cases and Applications

### Ideal For:
1. **Enterprise Applications**: High-volume processing with cost constraints
2. **Multilingual Services**: Applications requiring support for multiple languages
3. **Document Processing**: Large-scale document analysis and summarization
4. **Code Analysis**: Understanding and generating code across projects
5. **Content Moderation**: Processing user-generated content at scale
6. **Customer Support**: Multilingual customer service applications

### Specific Use Cases:
- International business communications
- Global content localization
- Multi-language documentation systems
- Cross-cultural analysis and research
- Large-scale data processing pipelines

## Limitations and Considerations

### Access Restrictions
- Starting April 29, 2025: Not available for new projects
- Only accessible to projects with prior usage
- Migration to newer models strongly recommended

### Migration Path
Recommended migration targets:
1. **Gemini 2.0 Flash**: For most use cases
2. **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: For advanced reasoning needs
3. **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: For best price/performance

### Technical Considerations
- Both versions are considered legacy
- No new features or improvements planned
- Support may be limited in the future
- Rate limits apply based on usage tier

## Version Selection Guide

### Choose Version 002 If:
- Multilingual support is critical
- Working with non-English content
- Need latest quality improvements
- Starting a new implementation

### Version 001 May Be Suitable If:
