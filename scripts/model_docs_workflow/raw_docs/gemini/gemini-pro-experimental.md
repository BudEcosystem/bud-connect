""")
print(response.text)
```

### Advanced Features
```python
# Using tool capabilities
tools = [
    {
        "function_declarations": [{
            "name": "search",
            "description": "Search the web for information",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "query": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }]
    }
]

model = genai.GenerativeModel(
    'gemini-2.0-pro-experimental',
    tools=tools
)

# Using the 2M token context window
with open('large_document.txt', 'r') as file:
    large_context = file.read()
    
response = model.generate_content([
    f"Analyze this document: {large_context}",
    "Provide a comprehensive summary and key insights"
])
```
