# OpenAI o1-preview Model Documentation

## Model Overview

OpenAI o1-preview is an advanced AI model designed to enhance reasoning capabilities and provide accurate responses to complex questions. It represents the initial release in the o1 family of models that utilize advanced reinforcement learning techniques combined with chain-of-thought reasoning to tackle complex problems in science, coding, and mathematics.

## Technical Specifications

### Context Window and Output Limits
- **Context window size**: 128,000 tokens
- **Maximum output tokens**: 32,768 tokens
- **Knowledge cutoff date**: October 1, 2023

### Architecture
- Based on transformer architecture with large-scale reinforcement learning
- Uses chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with internal "reasoning tokens"
- Enhanced with reinforcement learning to teach productive reasoning through chain of thought

### Performance Characteristics
- **Output speed**: 171.5 tokens per second
- **Time to First Token (TTFT)**: 17.03 seconds
- Slower response times compared to GPT-4o models due to internal reasoning process

## Capabilities and Features

### Enhanced Reasoning
- Utilizes reinforcement learning-enhanced chain-of-thought reasoning
- Can navigate deeper, more complex challenges without fixating on failed reasoning paths
- Learns to reason productively using its chain of thought in a data-efficient training process

### Mathematics Excellence
- Scored 83% on International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) qualifying exam (vs GPT-4o's 13%)
- Strong performance on American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) benchmark
- Excels at generating complex mathematical formulas for physics applications

### Coding Capabilities
- Reached 89th percentile in Codeforces competitions
- Effective at generating and debugging code
- Strong performance on HumanEval coding benchmarks
- Ranks among top 500 students in USA on AIME

### Scientific Research
- Performs similarly to PhD students on challenging benchmark tasks in physics, chemistry, and biology
- Can be used by healthcare researchers to annotate cell sequencing data
- Helps physicists generate complicated mathematical formulas for quantum optics

## Pricing Information

### API Pricing
- **Input tokens**: $15.00 per 1M tokens
- **Output tokens**: $60.00 per 1M tokens
- **Blended price** (3:1 ratio): $26.25 per 1M tokens

### Rate Limits (Beta Phase)
- **o1-preview**: 50 queries per week
- Initial access limited to developers who qualify for API usage tier 5
- 20 RPM rate limit for qualified developers

## API Usage Details

### Beta Phase Limitations
During the beta phase, the following limitations apply:
- **Text only**: Images are not supported
- **Message types**: User and assistant messages only, system messages not supported
- **Streaming**: Not supported
- **Tools**: Function calling and response format parameters not supported
- **Web browsing**: Not available
- **File uploads**: Not supported

### Reasoning Tokens
- The model uses "reasoning tokens" that represent its internal thought process
- These tokens are not visible through the API but consume space in the context window
- Reasoning tokens contribute to billing costs

### Best Practices
- Reserve at least 25,000 tokens for completion tokens
- Use straightforward prompts - avoid asking the model to "think step by step" as it already engages in chain-of-thought reasoning internally
- Use delimiters for clarity
- Limit extra context in retrieval-augmented generation scenarios

## Performance Benchmarks

### Overall Performance
- Leads in general performance (MMLU)
- Excels in code generation (HumanEval)
- Superior math problem-solving (MATH benchmark)
- SEAL Leaderboards show leading performance in Precise Instruction Following and Spanish-language fluency

### Safety and Security
- Scored 84 on hardest jailbreaking tests (vs GPT-4o's 22 on scale of 0-100)
- Advanced jailbreak resistance on Strong Reject benchmark
- Significant improvements in resisting common attacks from literature

## Use Cases and Applications

### Primary Use Cases
- Complex problems in science, coding, and mathematics
- Healthcare research for cell sequencing data annotation
- Physics applications requiring complicated mathematical formulas
- Multi-step workflow development and execution
- Educational applications requiring step-by-step reasoning

### Ideal Applications
- Tasks requiring enhanced reasoning capabilities
- Complex mathematical problem solving
- Advanced coding and debugging tasks
- Scientific research and analysis
- Problems where accuracy is more important than response time

## Limitations and Considerations

### Current Limitations
- Does not support many existing ChatGPT features like web browsing
- No image or file upload capabilities
- No image generation support
- No code interpreter tool
- Slower response times due to reasoning process

### When to Use GPT-4o Instead
- For many common use cases, GPT-4o will be more capable in the near term
- When reliably low latency is needed
- When multimodal input/output is required
- For tasks not requiring complex reasoning

### Cost Considerations
- Significantly more expensive than standard models
- Reasoning tokens contribute to billing but aren't visible
- Higher cost per token compared to GPT-4o family

## Availability

### Access Methods
- Available to ChatGPT Plus and Team users in ChatGPT
- API access for developers who qualify for usage tier 5
- Can be selected manually in the model picker

### Launch Limitations
- Weekly rate limits: 30 messages for o1-preview in ChatGPT
- API rate limit: 20 RPM for qualified developers
- Beta phase restrictions apply

## Future Development

The o1-preview model represents the initial release in OpenAI's reasoning model family, with the full o1 model expected to include significant improvements, including a 34% reduction in major errors on difficult problems and the ability to analyze and respond to uploaded images.
