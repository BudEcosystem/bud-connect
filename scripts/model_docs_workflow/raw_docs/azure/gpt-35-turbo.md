# Azure OpenAI Service - GPT-35-Turbo Model Documentation

## Model Overview and Description

GPT-35-Turbo is Azure OpenAI's implementation of OpenAI's GPT-3.5-Turbo model, representing Azure's specific naming convention (using hyphens instead of dots). This model is part of the newer "conversation-in and message-out" model series, specifically designed for multi-turn conversations while maintaining excellent performance for non-chat scenarios. GPT-35-Turbo is optimized for conversational interfaces and uses the Chat Completion API architecture.

## API Usage Details (Azure OpenAI API)

### Message Structure
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-35-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Assistant is a helpful chatbot"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Your question here"}
    ]
)
```

### Role-Based Messaging
- **System Role**: Sets assistant behavior and context
