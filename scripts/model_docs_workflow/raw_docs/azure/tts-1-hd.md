- **Styling Instructions**: Can include speaking style directions

### Output
- **Audio Formats**: MP3, OPUS, AAC, FLAC, WAV, PCM
- **Quality**: Higher bitrate and sampling rate than TTS-1
- **Latency**: Higher processing time due to quality optimization
- **File Size**: Larger file sizes due to higher quality

## Pricing Information
- **Cost**: $0.030 per 1,000 characters
- **Premium Pricing**: Exactly 2x the cost of standard TTS-1
- **Billing Precision**: Charged per actual character count
- **Value Proposition**: Higher cost justified by superior audio quality

## Available Voices
Same voice options as TTS-1 but with enhanced quality:
- **alloy**: Clear and versatile
- **echo**: Rich and warm tones
- **fable**: Dynamic range with expression
- **onyx**: Deep, resonant quality
- **nova**: Bright and engaging
- **shimmer**: Smooth and professional
- **Additional voices**: ash, ballad, coral, sage (with HD quality)

## API Usage Examples

### Basic HD Speech Generation
```python
import openai

response = openai.Audio.speech.create(
  model="tts-1-hd",
  voice="alloy",
  input="This is high-definition text-to-speech with superior quality."
)

response.stream_to_file("hd_output.mp3")
```

### Professional Narration
```python
response = openai.Audio.speech.create(
  model="tts-1-hd",
  voice="onyx",
  input="""Welcome to our premium audiobook experience. 
  This narration is produced using high-definition speech synthesis 
  for the best possible listening experience.""",
  speed=0.95  # Slightly slower for narration
)
```

### Multilingual HD Output
```python
# Generate HD speech in different languages
texts = {
    "en": "High quality English speech",
    "es": "Habla española de alta calidad",
    "fr": "Parole française de haute qualité",
    "de": "Hochwertige deutsche Sprache"
}

for lang, text in texts.items():
    response = openai.Audio.speech.create(
        model="tts-1-hd",
        voice="nova",
        input=text
    )
    response.stream_to_file(f"hd_output_{lang}.mp3")
```

### Broadcast Quality Audio
```python
# Generate broadcast-ready audio
response = openai.Audio.speech.create(
  model="tts-1-hd",
  voice="echo",
  input="This audio meets broadcast quality standards.",
  response_format="wav"  # Uncompressed for editing
)
```

## Best Practices
1. **Use Case Assessment**: Only use HD when quality is critical (cost is double)
2. **Voice Matching**: Test all voices in HD mode for best results
3. **Audio Post-Processing**: HD output is suitable for professional editing
4. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple texts together to optimize API calls
5. **Format Selection**: Use lossless formats (WAV, FLAC) to preserve HD quality
6. **Content Type**: Ideal for final production, not prototyping

## Limitations and Use Cases

### Limitations
- Higher cost (2x standard TTS-1)
- Increased latency compared to standard model
- Larger file sizes require more storage/bandwidth
- Not suitable for real-time applications requiring low latency
- Same voice limitations as TTS-1 (preset voices only)

### Use Cases
- **Professional Audiobook Production**: High-quality narration for commercial release
- **Podcast Creation**: Professional-grade podcast episodes
- **E-Learning Content**: Clear educational material narration
- **Corporate Communications**: Executive announcements and presentations
- **Media Production**: TV/radio commercials and documentaries
- **Voice-Over Work**: Product demos and marketing videos
- **Accessibility Solutions**: Premium screen readers and assistive technology
- **Museum/Gallery Guides**: High-quality audio tours
- **Meditation/Wellness Apps**: Soothing, clear guidance
- **Premium Voice Assistants**: Luxury brand applications

## Additional Notes
- HD model uses same underlying technology as TTS-1 but with quality optimizations
- The improvement is most noticeable in complex sentences and emotional content
- File sizes are typically 50-100% larger than standard TTS-1 output
- Consider A/B testing between TTS-1 and TTS-1-HD for your specific use case
- HD quality is preserved best in lossless formats
- Some users report the quality difference is subtle for simple text
- Ideal for content that will be listened to multiple times
- Can be combined with audio post-processing for even better results
- Future updates may include even more advanced voice options
