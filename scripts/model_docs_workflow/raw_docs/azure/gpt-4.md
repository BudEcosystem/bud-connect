## API Usage Examples

### Basic Text Completion
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the theory of relativity"}
  ]
)
```

### Vision Capabilities
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
```

### Function Calling (GPT-4-0613+)
```python
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "calculate",
            "description": "Perform mathematical calculations",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "expression": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }

### Migration Recommendations
- **From GPT-3.5**: Significant capability improvements justify cost increase
- **Version Updates**: Move from 0314 to 0613 versions for function calling
- **Future Planning**: Consider newer models like GPT-4o for better cost efficiency

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide explicit, detailed instructions
2. **Context Setting**: Use system messages to set behavior and context
3. **Examples**: Include few-shot examples for complex tasks
4. **Step-by-Step**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps
5. **Output Format**: Specify desired output format clearly

### Cost Optimization
1. **Model Selection**: Use standard GPT-4 unless 32K context is needed
2. **Prompt Length**: Optimize prompt length without sacrificing clarity
3. **Caching**: Implement response caching for repeated queries
4. **Batch Processing**: Use batch API when available for bulk operations

### Error Handling
1. **Rate Limits**: Implement proper rate limit handling
2. **Retry Logic**: Add exponential backoff for failed requests
3. **Validation**: Validate outputs, especially for function calling
4. **Monitoring**: Monitor token usage and costs
