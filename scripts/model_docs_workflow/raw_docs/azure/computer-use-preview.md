# Azure OpenAI Computer-Use-Preview Model Documentation

## Model Overview

The `computer-use-preview` is an experimental model developed by Azure OpenAI specifically for use with the Responses API computer use tool. This groundbreaking model enables AI to interact with computer systems and applications through their user interfaces, allowing for autonomous task execution across web browsers and desktop applications.

### Core Capabilities

The computer-use-preview model provides several key capabilities:

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Opens applications, clicks buttons, fills out forms, and navigates multi-page workflows
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: Interprets UI changes and adjusts actions accordingly in real-time
- **Cross-Application Task Execution**: Operates seamlessly across web-based and desktop applications
- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can describe tasks in plain language, and the model determines the correct UI interactions
- **Screenshot Analysis**: Processes visual context from screenshots to understand current environment state
- **Mouse & Keyboard Control**: Can control mouse movements, clicks, typing, and scrolling actions

## Technical Specifications

### Model Parameters
- **Context Window**: 8,192 tokens
- **Max Output Tokens**: 1,024 tokens
- **Training Data Cutoff**: October 2023
- **Model Type**: Experimental/Preview
- **API Integration**: Responses API only

### Supported Environments
- **Browsers**: Full web browser automation support
- **Operating Systems**: Windows, macOS, Ubuntu
- **Integration Libraries**: Recommended use with Playwright for browser automation

## Azure-Specific Features

### Access Control
- **Limited Access Model**: Requires approval through Microsoft's eligibility criteria
- **Application Process**: Must complete the computer-use-preview limited access model application
- **Enterprise Integration**: Seamless integration with Azure OpenAI Service infrastructure

### Regional Availability
Currently available in the following Azure regions:
- East US 2 (eastus2)
- Sweden Central (swedencentral)
- South India (southindia)

### Security and Safety Features
- **Malicious Instruction Detection**: Built-in safety mechanisms to detect potentially harmful instructions
- **Irrelevant Domain Detection**: Identifies when tasks are outside the model's intended scope
- **Sensitive Domain Warnings**: Provides warnings for interactions with sensitive data or applications
- **Human Acknowledgment Requirements**: Requires human confirmation for certain high-risk actions

## API Usage Details

### Responses API Integration
The computer-use-preview model operates exclusively through the Azure OpenAI Responses API, following this interaction pattern:

1. **Task Initiation**: Send initial task description in natural language
2. **Action Suggestion**: Model analyzes current state and suggests specific actions (click, type, scroll)
3. **Action Execution**: Application code executes the suggested actions
4. **Screenshot Capture**: Current state is captured via screenshot
5. **Feedback Loop**: Screenshot is sent back to model for analysis
6. **Iteration**: Process repeats until task completion or termination

### Example API Workflow
```python
# Initialize Responses API with computer-use-preview model
# Send task: "Fill out the contact form on this webpage"
# Receive action: {"action": "click", "coordinates": [150, 300]}
# Execute action and capture screenshot
# Send screenshot back to model
# Continue until form is completed
```

## Pricing Information

### Azure OpenAI Service Pricing Structure
The computer-use-preview model follows Azure OpenAI Service's standard pricing model:

- **Pay-As-You-Go**: Flexible pricing based on actual usage
- **Provisioned Throughput Units (PTUs)**: Reserved capacity for predictable workloads
- **Token-Based Billing**: Charges based on input and output tokens processed

**Note**: Specific pricing for the computer-use-preview model may vary due to its experimental nature. Consult Azure pricing documentation for current rates.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Capabilities Assessment
- **Task Completion Rate**: High success rate for standard web automation tasks
- **Adaptation Speed**: Real-time adjustment to UI changes
- **Multi-Step Workflow Handling**: Capable of managing complex, multi-application workflows
- **Error Recovery**: Can identify and recover from failed actions

**Note**: As an experimental model, comprehensive benchmarks are still being developed.

## Use Cases and Applications

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Web Automation**: Automated form filling, data entry, and web scraping
2. **Testing and QA**: Automated UI testing across applications
3. **Workflow Automation**: Multi-step business process automation
4. **Data Migration**: Moving data between systems with different interfaces
5. **Accessibility Tools**: Assisting users with computer interaction challenges

### Enterprise Applications
- **RPA (Robotic Process Automation)**: Advanced process automation capabilities
- **Legacy System Integration**: Bridging older systems without APIs
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing of user interfaces
- **Employee Productivity**: Automating repetitive computer tasks

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- **Preview Status**: Experimental model not recommended for production use
- **Token Limits**: Constrained by 8,192 token context window
- **Training Data Age**: Knowledge cutoff at October 2023
- **Platform Dependency**: Requires specific integration libraries

### Safety Considerations
- **Human Supervision Required**: Not suitable for autonomous operation without oversight
- **Sensitive Data Risk**: Should not be used with confidential or sensitive information
- **Environmental Control**: Requires controlled test environment for safe operation
- **Iteration Limits**: Should implement safeguards to prevent infinite loops

### Deployment Restrictions
- **Limited Access**: Requires approval for access
- **Regional Constraints**: Available only in specific Azure regions
- **Preview Model Lifecycle**: Microsoft may upgrade or modify the model without notice

## Azure Deployment Regions

### Current Availability
- **East US 2**: Primary deployment region
- **Sweden Central**: European deployment option
- **South India**: Asia-Pacific deployment option

### Deployment Requirements
- Valid Azure OpenAI Service resource
- Approved access to computer-use-preview model
- Deployment in supported region
- Responses API endpoint configuration

## Development Recommendations

### Best Practices
1. **Environment Isolation**: Always test in isolated, non-production environments
2. **Human Oversight**: Implement human approval workflows for critical actions
3. **Error Handling**: Build robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. **Iteration Control**: Implement limits to prevent uncontrolled execution loops
5. **Security Measures**: Avoid exposing sensitive data or systems to the model

### Integration Guidelines
- Use recommended libraries like Playwright for browser automation
- Implement comprehensive logging for audit trails
- Set up proper authentication and access controls
- Monitor model behavior for unexpected actions

## Future Considerations
