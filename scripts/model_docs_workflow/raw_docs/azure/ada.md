# Azure OpenAI Service - Ada (text-embedding-ada-002) Model Documentation

## Model Overview and Description

The Ada model (text-embedding-ada-002) is Azure OpenAI's second-generation embedding model designed for generating text embeddings. This model has been a reliable choice for converting text into vector representations, though Microsoft recommends considering the newer third-generation embedding models (text-embedding-3-large and text-embedding-3-small) for better performance, particularly in multi-language tasks.

## Technical Specifications

### Model Versions
- **Available Versions**: 2 known versions (v1 and v2)
- **Recommended Version**: v2 (latest)

### Parameters and Limits
- **Max Request Tokens**: 8,192 (v2), 2,046 (v1)
- **Output Dimensions**: 1,536 (fixed)
- **Training Data Cutoff**: September 2021
- **Input Items per Call**: Up to 2,048 input items per embedding call

### Context Window
- **Context Length**: Up to 8,192 tokens (v2)
- **Token Processing**: Text is broken down into tokens (words or character chunks)
- **Example**: "hamburger" → "ham", "bur", "ger"; "pear" → single token

## Azure-Specific Capabilities and Features

### API Integration
- **Compatible APIs**: Embedding API requests only
- **Request Format**: Supports batch processing with up to 2,048 input items
