            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    }
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Boston?"}
    ],
    functions=functions,
    function_call="auto"
)
```

### JSON Mode
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125",
    response_format={ "type": "json_object" },
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "Output JSON only"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "List 3 colors with hex codes"}
    ]
)
```

### Streaming Response
```python
stream = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a story"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

4. **JSON Parsing**: Use JSON mode for reliable formatting

### Error Handling
```python
import time
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def call_with_retry(messages, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
                messages=messages
            )
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
            else:
                raise e
```
