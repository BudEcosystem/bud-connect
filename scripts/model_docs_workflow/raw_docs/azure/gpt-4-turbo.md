## API Usage Details

### Basic Implementation
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the theory of relativity."}
  ]
)
```

### Vision Processing
```python
response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "text", "text": "What's in this image?"},
        {
          "type": "image_url",
          "image_url": {
            "url": "https://example.com/image.jpg"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
```

### Long Context Usage
```python
# Utilizing the 128K context window
long_document = "..." # Your long document here

response = client.chat.completions.create(
  model="gpt-4-turbo",
  messages=[
