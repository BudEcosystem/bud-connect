## API Usage Details

### Serverless Endpoints
```python
# Example API usage
import together

together.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

response = together.Complete.create(
    model="together-ai-21.1b-41b",  # Replace with specific model name
    prompt="Your prompt here",
    max_tokens=150,
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### Dedicated Endpoints
- Customizable GPU endpoints with per-minute billing
- Support for custom fine-tuned models
- Guaranteed capacity and performance

## Performance Benchmarks

### Speed Metrics

- Typical response latency: Sub-second for most queries
- Throughput: Scales linearly with additional resources

### Quality Benchmarks
- Competitive performance on standard benchmarks (MMLU, GSM8K, etc.)
- Balanced trade-off between model size and capability
- Suitable for production workloads requiring high quality outputs

## Use Cases and Applications

### Ideal Use Cases
1. **Customer Service Automation**: Sophisticated chatbots and support systems
2. **Content Generation**: Long-form content creation with nuanced understanding
3. **Code Assistant**: Development tools and code generation applications
4. **Data Analysis**: Natural language interfaces for data exploration
5. **Document Processing**: Understanding and generating complex documents

### Industry Applications
- **Finance**: Risk analysis, report generation, compliance documentation
- **Healthcare**: Medical documentation, patient interaction systems
- **Education**: Personalized tutoring, content creation
- **Technology**: Code review, documentation generation, technical support

## Limitations and Considerations

### Technical Limitations
- Context window limitations may require chunking for very long documents
- Not suitable for edge deployment due to model size
- Requires stable internet connection for API access

### Cost Considerations
- Higher cost than smaller models (under 8B parameters)
- More economical than 80B+ parameter models
- Batch processing offers significant cost savings for bulk operations

### Best Practices
1. Use appropriate temperature settings for your use case
2. Implement proper prompt engineering for optimal results
3. Consider batch processing for cost optimization
4. Monitor token usage to manage costs effectively
5. Use dedicated endpoints for consistent high-volume workloads

## Compliance and Security

- **SOC 2 Compliant**: Enterprise-grade security standards
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Available in Scale tier
- **Data Privacy**: Your data remains private and is not used for model training
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Models can be exported and run elsewhere
