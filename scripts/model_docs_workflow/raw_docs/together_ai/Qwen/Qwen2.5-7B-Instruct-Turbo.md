## Limitations and Considerations

### Model Size Limitations
- As a 7B parameter model, it may not match the performance of larger models on highly complex tasks
- May require more careful prompt engineering for optimal results

### Context Management
- While supporting 128K+ tokens, performance may degrade with extremely long contexts
- Optimal performance typically achieved with shorter, focused prompts

### Quantization Trade-offs
- FP8 quantization provides speed benefits but may introduce minimal accuracy trade-offs in certain edge cases
- Generally maintains high quality across most use cases

### Computational Efficiency
- Optimized for speed and efficiency
- Suitable for real-time applications and resource-constrained environments
- Lower computational requirements compared to larger models

## Best Practices

### Prompt Engineering
1. **Clear Instructions**: Provide specific, clear instructions for best results
2. **Context Setting**: Use system prompts to establish context and behavior
3. **Structured Requests**: When requesting JSON or structured output, specify the format clearly
4. **Temperature Control**: Use lower temperatures (0.1-0.3) for factual tasks, higher (0.7-0.9) for creative tasks

### Performance Optimization
1. **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests for efficiency
2. **Context Length**: Keep prompts concise while providing necessary context
3. **Multi-turn Conversations**: Leverage the model's ability to maintain context across turns
4. **Fallback Strategies**: Implement error handling for edge cases

### Integration Tips
1. **API Rate Limits**: Respect Together AI's rate limits and implement appropriate backoff strategies
2. **Cost Management**: Monitor token usage to manage costs effectively
3. **Response Validation**: Implement validation for critical applications
4. **Caching**: Cache responses for repeated queries to reduce costs and latency
