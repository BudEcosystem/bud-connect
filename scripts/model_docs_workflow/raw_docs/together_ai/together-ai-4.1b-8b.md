## API Usage Details

### Quick Start Example
```python
import together

# Initialize client
together.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Chat completion
response = together.Chat.create(
    model="together-ai-4.1b-8b",  # Replace with specific model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."}
    ],
    max_tokens=200,
    temperature=0.7
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Streaming Example
```python
# Streaming responses
stream = together.Chat.create(
    model="together-ai-4.1b-8b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a short story"}],
    stream=True
)

for chunk in stream:
    if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end="")
```

### Batch Processing
```python
# Batch inference for cost savings
batch_requests = [
    {"prompt": "Summarize this text: ...", "max_tokens": 100},
    {"prompt": "Translate to Spanish: ...", "max_tokens": 150},
    # ... more requests
]

batch_response = together.Batch.create(
    model="together-ai-4.1b-8b",
    requests=batch_requests
)
```

## Performance Benchmarks

## Getting Started Guide

### Step 1: Account Setup
1. Create account at together.ai
2. Verify email and complete profile
3. Add payment method (optional for free tier)

### Step 2: API Key Generation
```bash
# Set environment variable
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

### Step 3: SDK Installation
```bash
# Python
pip install together

# Node.js
npm install together-ai

# Or use REST API directly
```

### Step 4: First API Call
```python
import os
import together

together.api_key = os.environ.get("TOGETHER_API_KEY")

response = together.Chat.create(
    model="together-ai-4.1b-8b",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello, AI!"}]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Step 5: Monitor Usage
- Check dashboard for token usage
- Set up billing alerts
- Review performance metrics
- Optimize based on patterns

## Best Practices

### Cost Optimization
- Use batch processing for non-real-time needs
- Implement aggressive caching strategies
- Set appropriate max_tokens limits
- Monitor and optimize prompt lengths

### Performance Optimization
- Use dedicated endpoints for consistent high-volume traffic
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Load balance across multiple API keys if needed
- Consider regional endpoints for lower latency

### Security Considerations
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Implement rate limiting in your application
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Regular key rotation for production systems
