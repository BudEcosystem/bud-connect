# Standard chat completion
response = together.Chat.create(
    model="together-ai-8.1b-21b",  # Replace with specific model name
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are a knowledgeable assistant specializing in business analysis and strategy."
        },

    ],
    max_tokens=800,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Advanced Usage Patterns
```python
# Streaming for real-time applications
def stream_response(prompt):
    stream = together.Chat.create(
        model="together-ai-8.1b-21b",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        stream=True,

    )
    
    full_response = ""
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            print(content, end="", flush=True)
            full_response += content
    
    return full_response

# Function calling for structured outputs
response = together.Chat.create(
    model="together-ai-8.1b-21b",

    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ.get('TOGETHER_API_KEY')}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    
    data = {
        "model": "together-ai-8.1b-21b",
        "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
        "max_tokens": max_tokens,
        "temperature": 0.7
    }
    
    response = requests.post(
        "https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions",
        headers=headers,
        json=data
    )
    
    return response.json()
```

### Microservices Architecture
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
import together

app = FastAPI()

class ChatRequest(BaseModel):
    message: str
    max_tokens: int = 500
    temperature: float = 0.7

@app.post("/chat")
async def chat_endpoint(request: ChatRequest):
    try:
        response = together.Chat.create(
            model="together-ai-8.1b-21b",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": request.message}],
            max_tokens=request.max_tokens,
            temperature=request.temperature
        )
        return {"response": response.choices[0].message.content}
    except Exception as e:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=str(e))
```
